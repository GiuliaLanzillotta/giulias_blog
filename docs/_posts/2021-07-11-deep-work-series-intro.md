If any of the answers to these question is yes, I think you'll find this series of posts interesting.  <!--more-->

# The series

<div align="justify">
This is the a series of four articles that will revisit from a personal experience perspective some of the concepts emerging from the book titled "Deep Work" by Cal Newport. These articles belong to a single essay which I had written now more than an year ago and never published for its discouraging length. The series is organised as follows: except for the first article, which also bears an introduction within itself, each post will be centered around a lesson. Working out the math you get four lessons in total. It certainly is going to be a reductive account of the content of the book that inspires the series, which is not meant to be by any means a complete summary of the former. The ideal reader would approach these blog posts with the spirit of a child who is about to be told a bedtime story: no expectations, but a curios mind.
