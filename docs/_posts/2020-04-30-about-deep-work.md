## Intro

This is my first book review, and it's also the first time I talk about productivity, therefore I will spend a few words on the context. 

I don't remember how I ended up here writing this article, but time management has a central role in my life today. I can honestly admit I (sometimes) obsess over planning and the main reason why I keep scheduling my weeks is simply to make sure not to waste a minute living a life I would not be proud of. <br>
As [Mark Manson](https://markmanson.net/) puts it: 

> Every moment of every day, whether you realize it or not, you are making a decision on how to spend your time, on what to pay attention to, on where to direct your energy. [...]
Our values are constantly reflected in the way we choose to behave.<br>

As a recent book from [David Allen](https://gettingthingsdone.com/) titles, *productivity is the ability of getting things done*. All these productivity *"studies"* recently flooding the internet usually (check for yourself) transcend the specifics of what you are actually "getting done", which has always been the subject of philosophy, or theology. Instead productivity offers a pseudo-scientific, rigorous approach to stay true to the goals we have set for ourselves, avoiding to spend (too much) time on "things" that we do not value. 

Now, getting practical, <mark>productivity is hard</mark>.  <br>
Forget the idea of a *perfect routine*. Your environment is an unpredictable flux to which you need to promptly adapt. In software engineering terms, planning is a [*continuous delivery*](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ContinuousDelivery.html). The goal is not to build a finalized product (i.e. the perfect schedule), but instead to make sure that it keeps working even when its main components are subject to modifications. Chasing productivity is like running in circles: there is no finish line, your only target is to keep going. And to endure that you'll need a lot of <ins>will power</ins>, but fear not, as it can be trained just like any muscle in your body and authors like Cal Newport can be our coaches.

I have been collecting <i>productivity heuristics</i> through the last 3-4 years, unaware of the public discourse on the subject, to which I was introduced only recently. This discovery offered me the chance to compare my findings to what the "experts" are saying on the topic at the moment, and sharing the results of this comparison is exactly the goal of this post.


<br>
## The book

This book is first of all an eulogy and an apology of what Newport defines "*deep work*": 
> Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.

Indeed the book is organized in two sections and the first one is entirely dedicated to the definition of deep work in contrast to shallow work. 
<br>In the span of three chapters, Newport describes deep work as a crucial skill "*for anyone looking to move ahead in a globally competitive information economy that tends to chew up and spit out those who aren’t earning their keep*". In order to support his thesis he submits to the reader multiple references from psychological, neurological and social studies to centuries old and recent successful stories, with arguments covering a wide range of subjects. He also provides the reader with the following formula: <br>
<div align="center">High-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent) x (Intensity of Focus)</div>
<br>

This blog post, however, is about productivity so we'll only be concerned with the second part of the book, which introduces the reader to a series of techniques and tricks (which he calls the "rules") to improve his own deep work skill. I believe many of these suggestions to be applicable in a more general context, and hence I decided to discuss the main takes from this second half in productivity terms. <br>

Let me start with a disclaimer or what I consider the main critique I have to move to the book.<br>
The chapters (of this second part) follow a regular pattern: each of them begins with a rough explanation of its topic, which is then developed by progressively zooming into it, i.e. discussing in more and more depth the implementation side. This scheme probably aims at leaving the reader with as much guidance as possible when it comes to implementation. Going from the theory read in a book to the everyday practice is hard, especially if you're not given any material advice. However, in my opinion too many details can trap the user in, making him lose sight of the underlying idea. <br>
<mark> Productivity is a personal journey </mark>, and any attempt to shape it into a prescription is doomed to fail. <br>
In this productivity resembles art: the goal of the mentor is to share the basic techniques, but, most of all, to nurture the intuition and the spirit of its students; it's up to the learner to use the given knowledge to create its own artwork. 

I nonetheless consider Newport's concepts to be valuable and useful, and I've been experimenting with most of these ideas myself. This seems a good point to start diving into the cool stuff. 
<br>
<br>


### Lesson #1:  Embrace boredom
A natural measure for the quality of one's planning is **efficiency**, which we can formally phrase as the number of goals accomplished per day, or -to leave some elasticity- the percentage of tasks closed per week. It follows that, armed with a better planning, one will never have to turn down opportunities, and hence an increase in productivity should be reflected by an increase in the number of projects he's simultaneously managing.<br>

This perspective leads to embrace multitasking as it was some fairy dust only waiting to be discovered. "Two grains of multitasking and you're done!" The underlying idea is that economic, social or even personal growth requires a similar increase in efficiency. That nothing is impossible as we just need to manage our time more wisely, to be more productive, more efficient in order to accomplish one, two or even a thousand more goals. More, more, more...<br> 
Unfortunately, research shows that this approach is not sustainable for human beings, and, for what it's worth, I can empirically support the thesis from my personal experience as a "*multitasker*" (but this is another story).<br>
In the introduction to the chapter Cal Newport cites [this interesting interview](https://www.npr.org/2013/05/10/182861382/the-myth-of-multitasking?t=1599744251093) from Clifford Nass, who describes the *myth of multitasking* as follows: 

> **N**: So we have scales that allow us to divide up people into people who multitask all the time and people who rarely do, and the differences are remarkable. People who multitask all the time can't filter out irrelevancy. They can't manage a working memory. They're chronically distracted. 

And a few sentences later: 

> **I**: So they - all because they have been multitasking- they've lost that ability to focus on one thing.<br>
**N**: That's precisely right. Our brains have to be retrained to multitask and our brains, if we do it all the time - brains are remarkably plastic, remarkably adaptable. We train our brains to a new way of thinking. And then when we try to revert our brains back, our brains are plastic but they're not elastic. They don't just snap back into shape.

As Nass is highlighting here, <mark>there is a fallacy in the efficiency-is-the-key mindset</mark>. <br> 
The problem stems from the fact that the mind easily develops addiction for stimuli, and anything that represents a distraction from your current occupation will come to you in form of a physical (visual, auditory, ...) stimulus. Think about this: how often do you find yourself doing exactly nothing, letting your mind free to wander without cracking under the pressure of refreshing your favorite social homepage, picking up a new activity or simply checking (again) the email?

What professor Nass is revealing is that multitasking has consequences, which is far from a known and a surely underestimated fact.
If you keep intensifying your routine and filling up your calendar, maybe to the point where you start multitask obsessively, your mind is going to adapt to an high frequency stream of inputs and you will gradually lose your ability to stay more than 2 minutes on any given task. 

<!-- Even though it is hard to accept, we must face the truth, which is that we humans have limits, like the number of days we got left to live, or the length of the longest sequence of numbers that we can memorize. The number of activities you can commit to on each day is another example of such a limit, and there's no scheduling trick that can help you escape this rule.<br> -->

*So what should we do instead?*


#### Forget efficiency, embrace boredom.
This is the lesson (or rule, as he defines it) that Cal Newport conveys throughout a chapter. It tackles the current limit of your concentration abilities together with your desire for distraction, and suggests a few strategies that can help the reader rewire his brain to a configuration better suited to staying on task.<br> *Productive meditation, distraction breaks, hard deadlines for focused tasks* are some examples of the strategies suggested by Cal Newport to "*strengthen your distraction-resisting muscles*", and "*improve your ability to think deeply*". I will not cover them in detail now, but I would like to spend a few words on the core concept: embracing boredom. 

When later today you will find yourself free from your daily business try to notice where your mind goes, what it craves, how instinctively it tries to avoid boredom. And if you manage to become aware of this automatic process, try to fight it by simply doing nothing. Again, embrace boredom.<br>
What Newport is saying here should seem counter-intuitive to those of us accustomed to the breaks-averse, the work-until-you-pass-out approach. The shift in perspective is radical: to be more productive you should do less! Instead of banning breaks from your workday you should plan them. Vacancy is glorified, not vilified. Instead of chasing efficiency with some kind of schedule *horror vacui*, we should dig holes in our routines as the most powerful weapon against shallowness is pure emptiness. The right anthem therefore is not "*more,more,more*", but "*less, less, less*"... 


Implementation side-note: 
Here talk about sport as a vacuum producer.<br>


<!--

Newport reserves an entire section of the book to argue the importance of the ability to work in a deep mode (chapter 1 to 3), contextualizing the need of this skill in the Internet era. <br>
He focuses on an intellectual kind of work, like the one he does, being an associate professor of computer science at Georgetown University. However, I believe we can extend the definition of Deep Work to a whole *attitude towards life*, which we could maybe call *Deep mode* and phrase as follows: 
> **Deep Mode**: A state of distraction-free concentration that keeps you fully immersed in your current activity. <br> 

What I here call *deep mode* is similar in spirit to what in positive psychology is known as [*the flow*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)) or *the zone*. Call it *Deep work* or *Deep mode* or even *Flow*, the problem is that focus does not get along well with a frenetic routine. 

[](https://web.archive.org/web/20131110043540/http://articlescoertvisser.blogspot.com/2007/11/good-business-leadership-flow-and.html)

This last point is the one upon which Newport builds his argument, depicting the ability to work in *a deep way* as essential to obtain a certain level of quality in your results, if not to get results at all. The problem is that a slow-rate working mode does not match a frenetic routine. The deep work settings usually require your brain to engage in a prolonged effort while receiving little to no rewards at all, with a few inputs that come in at a low frequency. As you might have noticed, reading a scientific article feels different from writing an e-mail, having a phone call or attending a conference. The reason is that you're using your brain at two fundamentally distinct rates.<br>


While jdhbfj you think you'll do more you actually end up doing less.

### Lesson #2: γνῶθι σεαυτόν (know thyself)

Transliterated as "gnōthi seauton" lesson #2 traces back to ancient Greece. Popularly associated with the philosopher Socrates, it is actually attributed to multiple figures. I should say that this aphorism is not really in the book, but the idea is indirectly mentioned in the chapter dedicated to *rule #1: work deeply*. <br> 
Rule #1 is about helping the reader smooth into a more deep-work compatible routine. Newport presents six strategies to "hijack your brain’s motivation center" and "recharge your willpower reserves at the fastest possible rate". The main obstacle being faced here can be summarized as follows: 
> You have a finite amount of willpower that becomes depleted as you use it.

Hence, Newport says, if you really want to tackle your habits it is not enough to be motivated (no matter how good your reasons may be): over time distractions (aka any-desire-in-contrast-with-your-current-occupation) will get the best of your intentions. Notice that, as I anticipated above, although Newport is here focusing on the transition from shallow to deep work, this point can actually be made in the more general context of changing habits (the classic 'following a new diet' falling into this category).

*So, what is Newport's advice?*

#### Be smart about your habits.

Drastic change requires an infinite amount of will power in order to work. However, we can make things easier for us if we only >know ourselves. Just by knowing his weak spots one can minimize the amount of willpower needed to achieve the set goals by <mark>acting on the environment instead of acting on himself</mark>. 

Let me give you a personal example many of you will probably be familiar with.
I have now many times tried to decrease the time spent on social networks. Any app store is packed with apps whose only job is to help you quit checking your phone. The maybe most natural approach is to <ins>just rely on your willpower</ins>: whenever you're about to open a social media simply stop.  Spoiler alert: it does not work! At least, it did not cut it for me. You usually make it through the first day, and if your motivation is strong enough you can even make it through a week, but sooner or later you will feel depleted of any energy to resist the temptation. You will feel defeated, and in the end you're going to give in to the old habit. Addictive social media: 1 / Me: 0. <br> 
Having read this book I decided to adopt what we shall call a *Newport-smart* approach. <br>
<mark>I started by observing myself</mark>. When was I most compelled to pick up the phone? What was happening just before the scrolling? I noticed that the gesture was automatic, almost mechanic. It would happen whenever I had some free time, or when I was about to face a challenging concept, that required concentration to be understood. Additionally, it would happen that, feeling obliged to answer to texts, I would find myself half an hour later trapped into some conversation. Chatting is not the root of all evils, but it shouldn't be prioritized over any other activity. <br>
<mark>I then proceeded to act on the environment.</mark> First of all, I established "chatting hours", as I knew it would have made me feel better knowing that sooner or later I would take time to answer the texts. Secondly, I would purposely hide my phone from my sight, and put it at least at arm length distance, preferably in another room. In this way the habit had its legs cut off. Addictive social media: 1 / Me: 1.

You should now start seeing the point of this lesson. To know oneself is among the most effective weapons available to fight bad habits, as changing "the environment" is <ins>way easier</ins> than changing oneself. Evidence for this thesis is spread all over the internet in the innumerable articles on productivity (like this one) that come out everyday with some fresh and promising tricks to try out. 

In the chapter under consideration Cal Newport exposes a few techniques to help you drag yourself into a deep work schedule, some good examples being: *ritualize*, *make grand gesture* and *don't work alone*. These tips mostly rely on some basic psychology principles which come in very handy such cases (for those of you interested I suggest reading [this](https://www.amazon.com/Influence-Psychology-Persuasion-Robert-Cialdini/dp/006124189X) book).<br>
However, you don't need to be an expert in psychology in order to be productive: you "only" need to know yourself. And in order to get to know yourself better I suggest you start from observation. Ask yourself the right questions, and try to give honest answers. Self-awareness is a tremendously valuable asset in productivity.<br>

In the following lessons the discourse will get more practical, as I'll dive into two of my favorite psychology-driven productivity tips, which I believe to be general enough to be easily adaptable to almost any routine.


### Lesson #3: measures! 

At the beginning of this post I described productivity as a pseudo-scientific approach to everyday life. As for any scientific discipline, it is necessary to define measures. Newport touches on measures in the chapter dedicated to *rule #1* as part of the dispensed advices to help the reader adopt a "deep routine". <br>
The ideas discussed in this section build upon the book *[the 4 disciplines of execution](https://www.franklincovey.com/the-4-disciplines.html)*. As the title anticipates, the authors (Chris McChesney, Jim Huling, and Sean Covey) propose 4 "disciplines" to guide companies from the "what" to the "how". 

> It’s often straightforward to identify a strategy needed to achieve a goal, but what traps up companies is figuring out how to execute the strategy once identified. 

Although the book is meant for the business world Newport manages to project it into the individuals' routine dimension through the lenses of personal work habits. Just like many companies, Newport argues, we often find ourselves lost into the 'how', once we've identified the 'what'. He then proceeds to summarize the four disciplines, drawing connections to deep work practices and tailoring them to meet the readers' interests.

I am probably going to disappoint you now as I'm not going to discuss these 4 disciplines with you. However, there is one concept that emerges from this business-minded methodology which I find worth contemplating with you, and that is the idea of *measures*. 

Second only to establishing priorities, that of identifying the right measures to track your progress is a fundamental step towards accomplishing your goals (be them to gain new clients, or simply to lose some weight). As the authors of 'the 4 disciplines' claim, the problem with measures is that <ins>people usually use the wrong ones</ins>. In this perspective, they make a useful distinction between what they call *lag* and *lead* measures. <br>
They call **lag measures** those that describe your ultimate goal: carrying on the examples above, we could identify as lag measures the number of clients gained in the first case and the amount of kg lost in the second one. <br>
On the other hand, **lead measures** are meant to keep track of the progress towards the goal by measuring "the new behaviors that will drive success on the lag measures". In the business goal case again, we could use as a lead measure the number of calls to the clients per day, while in our personal goal case, we could adopt as lead measure the number of weekly workouts. 

These are trivial (and non binding) examples, which hopefully help you understand the underlying concept. Simply put, the idea is that improving lead measures should seem straightforward, and as the numbers on the lead measures increase your lag measures will likely improve as well, rescuing you from the trap of the 'what'.

> Lead measures turn your attention to improving the behaviors you directly control in the near future that will then have a positive impact on your long-term goals.

Now, Newport proceeds to cast the method into the deep work framework, by suggesting lead measures to track the progress towards a more focused lifestyle. But not finding particularly insightful the specific suggestion, I wouldn't dwell on the details ... Just find measures that have an influence in your day-to-day behavior. 

To finish up the measures topic we also need a public expression of our commitment !
