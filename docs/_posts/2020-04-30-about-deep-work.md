## Intro

I can't remember how it started, but time management has a central role in my life today. The people who know me would probably say that I'm obsessed with schedules. And sometimes I have to agree with them. The reason why I relentlessly plan my days is to make sure not to waste time living a life I would not be proud of. <br>
As [Mark Manson](https://markmanson.net/) puts it: 

> Every moment of every day, whether you realize it or not, you are making a decision on how to spend your time, on what to pay attention to, on where to direct your energy. [...]
Our values are constantly reflected in the way we choose to behave.<br>

So, for me productivity is about giving value to what we do!<br>
As a recent book from [David Allen](https://gettingthingsdone.com/) titles, *productivity is the ability of getting things done*. All these productivity *"studies"* recently flooding the internet usually (check for yourself) transcend the specifics of what you are actually "getting done", which has always been the subject of philosophy, or theology. Instead productivity offers a pseudo-scientific, rigorous approach to stay true to the goals we have set for ourselves, avoiding to spend (too much) time on "things" that we do not value. 

Now, getting practical, <mark>productivity is hard</mark>.  <br>
There is no "*perfect routine*" because things change constantly. In software engineering terms, planning is a product in [*continuous delivery*](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ContinuousDelivery.html). The goal is not to find the shoe that fits your foot (i.e. the perfect schedule), but instead to learn to walk on the ones that you are given. Chasing productivity is like running in circles: there is no finish line, your only target is to keep going. And to endure the effort you'll need a lot of will power (a good motivation helps, but it is not enough). 

I have been collecting <i>productivity heuristics</i> through the last 3-4 years, unaware of the public discourse on the subject, to which I've only recently been introduced. This discovery offered me the chance to compare my findings to what the "experts" are saying on the topic at the moment, and sharing the results of this comparison is exactly the goal of this post.


<br>
## The book

This is not a book on productivity. I know, now you're confused. <br>
"Deep Work" is first of all an eulogy and an apology of what Newport defines (guess what) *deep work*: 
> Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.

Indeed the book is organized in two sections and the first one is entirely dedicated to the definition of deep work in contrast to "shallow work". 
<br>In the span of three chapters, Newport describes deep work as a crucial skill "*for anyone looking to move ahead in a globally competitive information economy that tends to chew up and spit out those who aren’t earning their keep*". In order to support his thesis he submits to the reader multiple arguments based on psychology, neuroscience and social science studies, as well as ancient and recent success stories. 

In this post we'll only consider the second part of the book, which introduces the reader to a series of techniques (called "rules") to improve the deep work skill. I believe many of these suggestions to be applicable in a more general context, and hence I decided to discuss the main takes from this second half in productivity terms. 
<br> 

Let me start with a **disclaimer**.<br>
In the chapters of this second part Newport exposes many different techniques, often zooming into the "implementation details". 
Going from the theory read in a book to the everyday practice is hard, especially if you're not given much material advice. However, <mark> productivity, like art, is a personal journey </mark>, and any attempt to shape it into a prescription is doomed to fail. Even equipped with the best of Newport advice, you will need to find out by yourself what works better for you. As always, the road to success is paved with failed attempts, so don't give up easily. 

Don't get me wrong: even though they need some adaptation, this book's concepts are anyway valuable and useful. I've been experimenting with most of them myself and I hope to sparkle some curiosity in you too with what I'll say next. <br>
Well, this seems a good point to start diving into the cool stuff. 
<br>
<br>


### Lesson #1:  Embrace boredom
What comes as a natural measure for the quality of a plan is **efficiency**, which we can formally phrase as the number of goals accomplished per day. 

<div align="right">
<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/SiEF80pqzJHhM3dOw0/giphy.gif" width="300" style="float: right;margin-right: 7px;margin-top: 0px;margin-btm:17px;">
</div>

<div align="justify">
Intuitively, efficiency is the direct answer to the question: "how much have you done today", which is to my surprise often confused with the question "how satisfied are you with your day"? <br>
In an ideal world the key to efficiency is a better plan: one doesn't have to turn down any  opportunity if he's a good enough planner. This perspective naturally leads to (obsessive) multitasking, which, let's be honest, works very well in the beginning. The problems arise when you let these early successes convince you that anything is achievable this way, that you just need to press down on the accelerator and you'll be in Dreams Town in the blink of an eye. <br>
</div>

<br>
<mark>FLASH NEWS</mark>: *human beings don't work this way*. <br>
In the introduction to the chapter Cal Newport cites [this interesting interview](https://www.npr.org/2013/05/10/182861382/the-myth-of-multitasking?t=1599744251093) from Clifford Nass, who describes the *myth of multitasking* as follows: 
> **N**: So we have scales that allow us to divide up people into people who multitask all the time and people who rarely do, and the differences are remarkable. People who multitask all the time can't filter out irrelevancy. They can't manage a working memory. They're chronically distracted. 

And a few sentences later: 

> **I**: So they - all because they have been multitasking- they've lost that ability to focus on one thing.<br>
**N**: That's precisely right. Our brains have to be retrained to multitask and our brains, if we do it all the time - brains are remarkably plastic, remarkably adaptable. We train our brains to a new way of thinking. And then when we try to revert our brains back, our brains are plastic but they're not elastic. They don't just snap back into shape.

As Nass is highlighting here, <mark>there is a fallacy in the efficiency-is-the-key mindset</mark>. <br> 
To summarise, the problem stems from the fact that the mind easily develops addiction to stimuli, and anything that represents a distraction from your current occupation will come to you in form of a stimulus. Think about this: how often do you find yourself doing exactly nothing, i.e. letting your mind free to wander without cracking under the pressure of refreshing your favorite social homepage, picking up a new activity or simply checking (again) the email?

What professor Nass is revealing is that multitasking has consequences, which is far from a known and a surely underestimated fact. And the consequence is that you will lose your ability to focus more than 2 minutes on any given task. 

<!-- Even though it is hard to accept, we must face the truth, which is that we humans have limits, like the number of days we got left to live, or the length of the longest sequence of numbers that we can memorize. The number of activities you can commit to on each day is another example of such a limit, and there's no scheduling trick that can help you escape this rule.<br> -->

*So what should we do instead?*



<div align="left">
<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/2UwXedfUGsXJfLR2XL/giphy.gif" width="300" style="float: left;margin-right: 7px;margin-top: 0px;margin-btm:17px;">
</div>

#### Forget efficiency, embrace boredom.
<div align = "justify">
This is "rule" number 2, and it is the subject of a whole chapter in the book (chapter 2, part 2).
The chapter dwells on ways to push the limit of your concentration, proposing a few strategies that can help the reader rewire his brain to a configuration better suited for staying on task. <br>

<i>Productive meditation, distraction breaks, hard deadlines for focused tasks</i> are some examples of the suggestions to "<i>strengthen your distraction-resisting muscles</i>", and "<i>improve your ability to think deeply</i>".
This is not what I will cover now though, as I would like to spend the last words in this section on the core concept: embracing boredom. <br>
</div>
<br>
When later today you will find yourself free from your daily business try to notice where your mind goes. Instinctively your attention will be drawn to any stimulus in your environment in order to escape boredom. Even knowing it, you will give in to this instinct without even noticing. However, not all hope is lost, as to gain control of our attention simply takes practice. Once aware of this automatic process, just try to fight it by simply not reacting to the stimulus: do nothing. *Embrace boredom*.

What Newport is saying here should seem counter-intuitive to those of us accustomed to the breaks-averse, the work-until-you-pass-out approach. The shift in perspective is radical: **to be more productive you should do less**.<br> 
Instead of banning breaks from your workday you should plan them. Vacancy is glorified, not vilified. Instead of chasing efficiency with some kind of schedule *horror vacui* we should be digging holes in our routines, as <mark>the most powerful weapon against shallowness is pure emptiness</mark>. <br>
The right anthem therefore is not "*more, more, more*", but "*less, less, less*"... 


side-note: Here talk about sport as a vacuum producer?<br>


<!--

Newport reserves an entire section of the book to argue the importance of the ability to work in a deep mode (chapter 1 to 3), contextualizing the need of this skill in the Internet era. <br>
He focuses on an intellectual kind of work, like the one he does, being an associate professor of computer science at Georgetown University. However, I believe we can extend the definition of Deep Work to a whole *attitude towards life*, which we could maybe call *Deep mode* and phrase as follows: 
> **Deep Mode**: A state of distraction-free concentration that keeps you fully immersed in your current activity. <br> 

What I here call *deep mode* is similar in spirit to what in positive psychology is known as [*the flow*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)) or *the zone*. Call it *Deep work* or *Deep mode* or even *Flow*, the problem is that focus does not get along well with a frenetic routine. 

[](https://web.archive.org/web/20131110043540/http://articlescoertvisser.blogspot.com/2007/11/good-business-leadership-flow-and.html)

This last point is the one upon which Newport builds his argument, depicting the ability to work in *a deep way* as essential to obtain a certain level of quality in your results, if not to get results at all. The problem is that a slow-rate working mode does not match a frenetic routine. The deep work settings usually require your brain to engage in a prolonged effort while receiving little to no rewards at all, with a few inputs that come in at a low frequency. As you might have noticed, reading a scientific article feels different from writing an e-mail, having a phone call or attending a conference. The reason is that you're using your brain at two fundamentally distinct rates.<br>


While jdhbfj you think you'll do more you actually end up doing less.

### Lesson #2: γνῶθι σεαυτόν (know thyself)

Transliterated as "gnōthi seauton" this renowned lesson traces back to ancient Greece. The aphorism itself is never mentioned in the book, but, as you're about to see, the concept is at the core of the discussion in chapter 1 (part 2), dedicated to *rule #1: work deeply*. <br> 
As the first thing to be asked when picking up a new habit is **where**-should-I-start, Rule #1 is about helping the reader smooth into a more deep-work compatible routine. The chapter presents 6 strategies to "*hijack your brain’s motivation center*" and "*recharge your willpower reserves at the fastest possible rate*". In fact, according to Newport, <ins>willpower</ins> the first thing you need to work on if you want to start "working deeply": 
> You have a finite amount of willpower that becomes depleted as you use it.

Basically, if you really want to tackle your habits it is not enough to be motivated (no matter how good your reasons may be): over time distractions will get the best of your intentions. <br>
As I anticipated above, although Newport is here focusing on the transition from shallow to deep work, this point can actually be made in the more general context of changing habits (think, for instance, of the classic 'following a new diet').

*So, what is Newport's advice? <br>How to survive a big change with a limited amount of willpower?*

#### Be smart about your habits.


Drastic, instantaneous change requires an infinite amount of willpower in order to work. <br>
However, Newport argues, we can make things easier for us if we only <i>know ourselves</i>. The insight is that acting on the environment is much easier than acting on ourselves. So, if we could find a way to make our environment help us stay on track, we'd need a lot less willpower.

</div>

<div align="justify">
Let me give you a personal example many of you will probably be familiar with. 
I have now many times tried to decrease the time spent on social networks. Any app store is packed with apps whose only job is to help you quit checking your phone. <br>
The maybe most natural approach is to <ins>just rely on your willpower</ins>: whenever you're about to open a social media simply stop.  <br>
<b>SPOILER ALERT</b>: it does not work! At least, it did not cut it for me (sadface). You usually make it through the first day, and if your motivation is strong enough you can even make it through a week, but sooner or later you will feel depleted of any energy to resist the temptation and you will give in to the old habit.<br>
<b>Addictive social media: 1 / Me: 0.</b> <br> 
</div>

Having read this book I decided to adopt what we shall call the *be-smart-about-your-habits* approach or simply the *Newport* approach.
<mark>I started by observing myself</mark>. *When was I most compelled to pick up the phone*? *What was happening just before the scrolling*? I noticed that the gesture was automatic, almost mechanic. It would happen whenever I had breaks, or when I was working on a mentally challenging task. I also noticed that, feeling obliged to answer to texts, whenever I picked up the phone I would find myself half an hour later trapped into some conversation. Chatting is not the root of all evils, but it shouldn't be prioritized over any other activity. <br>
<mark>I then proceeded to act on the environment.</mark> First of all, I established "chatting hours", as I knew it would have made me feel better knowing that sooner or later I would take the time to answer the texts. Secondly, I would purposely hide my phone from my sight, and put it at least at arm length distance, preferably in another room. In this way the habit had its legs cut off. <br>
<b>Addictive social media: 1 / Me: 1.</b>

You should now start seeing the point of this lesson. To know yourself (i.e. know what you crave and what you fear) is the most effective weapon available not only to fight bad habits but, I'd dare say, to achieve any goal. Evidence for this thesis is spread all over the internet in the innumerable articles on productivity (like this one) that come out everyday with some fresh and promising tricks ("try locking yourself in a room" kind of tricks) to try out. 

In the same chapter Cal Newport exposes a few techniques to help you drag yourself into a deep work schedule, some good examples being: *ritualize*, *make grand gesture* and *don't work alone*. These tips mostly rely on some basic psychology principles which come in very handy such cases (for those of you interested I suggest reading [this](https://www.amazon.com/Influence-Psychology-Persuasion-Robert-Cialdini/dp/006124189X) book).<br>
However, you don't need to be an expert in psychology in order to be productive: you "only" need to know yourself. And in order to get to know yourself better I suggest you start from observation. Ask yourself the right questions, and try to give honest answers. Self-awareness is a tremendously valuable asset in productivity, "use it well".
<br>
<br>

In the following (and last) lessons I'll dive into two of my favorite psychology-driven productivity tips, which I believe to be general enough to be easily adaptable to almost any routine.


### Lesson #3: measures! 

At the beginning of this post I described productivity as a pseudo-scientific approach to everyday life. Like in any other scientific discipline, it is necessary to define measures. Newport touches on measures in the chapter dedicated to *rule #1* as part of the dispensed advices that should help the reader implement a "deep routine". <br>

<div align="left">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/ruler.jpg" width="200" style="float: left;margin-right: 7px;margin-top: 0px;margin-bottom:17px;margin-left:0px;">
</div>

The ideas discussed in this section build upon the book *[the 4 disciplines of execution](https://www.franklincovey.com/the-4-disciplines.html)* (4DX). As the title anticipates, the authors (Chris McChesney, Jim Huling, and Sean Covey) propose 4 "disciplines" to guide companies from the "what" to the "how". 

> It’s often straightforward to identify a strategy needed to achieve a goal, but what traps up companies is figuring out how to execute the strategy once identified. 

Although the book is meant for the business world Newport applies it to the realm of individual work planning.  Just like many companies, Newport argues, we often find ourselves lost into the 'how', once we've identified the 'what'. He then proceeds to summarize the four disciplines, drawing connections to deep work practices and tailoring them to meet the readers' interests.

I am probably going to disappoint you now as I'm not going to discuss all 4 disciplines with you, although I'll mention one or two later. There is one concept that emerges from this business-minded methodology which I find worth contemplating with you, and that, as you might have guessed, is the idea of *measures*. 

Second only to establishing priorities, that of identifying the right measures to track your progress is a fundamental step towards accomplishing your goals (be them to increase your customer satisfaction, or simply to lose some weight). As the authors of 'the 4 disciplines' claim, the problem with measures is that <ins>people usually use the wrong ones</ins>. In this perspective, they make a useful distinction between what they call *lag* and *lead* measures. 

They call **lag measures** those that describe your ultimate goal: carrying on the examples above, we could identify as lag measures your customer satisfaction scores in the first case and the kgs lost in the second one. 

On the other hand, **lead measures** are meant to keep track of the progress towards the goal by measuring "*the new behaviors that will drive success on the lag measures*". In the business goal case again, we could use as a lead measure the number of customers who receive free samples (assuming giving free sample is a sensible business move), while in our personal goal case, we could adopt as lead measure the number of weekly workouts. 

These are trivial examples, which hopefully help you understand the underlying concept. In a nutshell, lead measures bridge the gap between the "what" and the "how", since you can expect your lag measures to eventually improve as you act on the lead measures. 

> Lead measures turn your attention to improving the behaviors you directly control in the near future that will then have a positive impact on your long-term goals.

<br>

Now, these are all fascinating ideas, but defining lag and lead measures is not enough to make real progress. As the authors of 4DX correctly identify, there's one more ingredient to add to the mix: **emotional engagement**. To be precise, you won't find the expression "emotional engagement" in the 4DX or the Deep Work books, as this is an abstraction of what they actually present. In fact, discipline #3, *keep a compelling scoreboard*, is just one way to obtain what I call emotional engagement.<br>
I am now going to explain to you the scoreboard idea, but I'm later going to propose an alternative (also falling under the emotional engagement umbrella) which worked better for me. This is maybe the best example I am going to give you in this article of that "fine tuning" work which I was mentioning in the beginning. Take what you read and make it yours.<br> 

As the 4DX authors explain, "*people play differently when they’re keeping score*"; the idea is to keep track of the progress on the lead measures publicly in order to naturally activate a sense of competition that keeps the team focused on these measures. Notice that again here we find a trick that leverages a simple and effective psychology rule: as I was writing before, psychology permeates the "field" of productivity heuristics.<br>
Now back to our Deep Work book. To adapt the idea to the deep work setting, Newport suggests introducing a physical artifact in the workplace that displays the personal progress on whatever lead measure one has adopted. He spends a short paragraph portraying the Deep-Work scoreboard. I'll spare you the description, but I'll mention one interesting take. What stands out from the crowd of details is the claimed benefit of a visceral, physical connection with our results. Newport is suggesting that tangible evidence of our progress may foster our motivation and additionally help calibrating our expectations on the work that we can get done.

I experimented with the Newport version of the 4DX technique (this is the case for every idea discussed in this article), and, as I anticipated above, I crafted an alternative which works better in my case. <br>
The physical scoreboard was not enough to keep me motivated: when the first excitement wore out I'd forget about using it, which in turn made it less effective. <br>
Knowing myself, I hypothesized that since there was no one except me checking the score, I felt free to drop it. I then devised a strategy that would force me to keep using the scoreboard: **I went public about my progress**. I used a virtual scoreboard that everyone could see and which would automatically track my lead measure. <br> 
This approach borrows at a high level from discipline #4, *Create a Cadence of Accountability*. The idea there is to schedule frequent meetings with your co-workers to confront the scoreboards. <br>
However, instead of competition as suggested by the 4DX authors I leveraged a force that I know to have a stronger pull on me: pride. Being held accountable for my work made the cut: I still use that same scoreboard.<br>
Additionally, it may help to involve your friends/colleagues in the game: share your scoreboard with them, and explain your goals. It doesn't matter if they will actually start checking it regularly: from that moment on your goals will feel more concrete and you'll work on the same goal with a new energy.<br>
The same principle proved to be effective in different contexts. One example is this website. Writing helps me reorganize my thoughts. Murakami can say it better than me: 
> Which is why I am writing this book. To think. To understand. It just happens to be the way I'm made. I have to write things down to feel I fully comprehend them.

So yes, I started this project for myself. But I'm sharing it not because I believe that someone apart from my friends/colleagues will ever casually stumble upon it (although I deep down hope so), but because I know that I would have dropped this article long ago if I hadn't already involved someone else in it. <br>

I hope that the general concept of emotional engagement and why it is beneficial got through. It is now time to close this topic and sail to the exploration of our fourth and last lesson.


### Lesson #4: The shutdown

This last lesson will be a short one. The idea is discussed in the same chapter that interested lesson #2 and lesson #3, which is maybe the most rich in practical advices.<br>
When I first read about the idea I was extremely excited because I had previously conceived a productivity heuristic (the *fuck-up day*) which precisely matched the concept. <br>
As you'll see, Newport's implementation differs from mine, but once again: productivity is a personal journey. <br>
The method is simple to execute, and surprisingly effective. I hope that when I'll be finished presenting it you'll share some of my enthusiasm for it. <br>
I'll first discuss the insight, to then briefly touch on the two implementations. <br>

The general concept is that our minds (as well as our bodies) need a **periodic shutdown** to function properly if they're regularly under pressure. This is not something that can be defeated with a bit of exercise: it's physiological. 
Newport as usual provides plenty of evidence in support of the idea, but I'll discuss my favorite one here. 

The attention restoration theory (ART) claims that spending time in nature (instead of in the city) can improve our ability to concentrate. This theory, which was first proposed in the 1980s by the University of Michigan psychologists Rachel Kaplan and Stephen Kaplan is based on the concept of *attention fatigue*. To concentrate requires what ART calls "*directed attention*". This resource is finite: If you exhaust it, you’ll struggle to concentrate. <br>
A paper from 2008 discovered a significant difference in the ability to concentrate between a group asked to take a walk in the city and another asked to walk in a park instead. A possible explanation for the phenomenon is that navigating through the busy city streets requires a consistent level of directed attention, while walking through nature keeps the mind stimulated without requiring directed attention. <br> 
But Newport is not suggesting to leave the city for the better, *hashtag #countrylife*. As he highlights, the implications of ART expand beyond the benefits of nature. The core mechanism of the theory is that you can restore your (highly valuable) ability to direct your attention by assigning some time to a relaxing activity. It doesn't have to be nature, but it must be something that fascinates you enough to avoid the risk of stopping to check emails in the middle of the break. Beware as the more pressuring your duties (think of an approaching deadline), the harder it will be to take a break from them, and hence the smarter you'll have to be when choosing the restoring activity.

This is most likely not the first time you hear about the benefits of relax, so what's all the fuss about? Thanks for the question. <br> 
The findings from ART theory are not praising rest per se, but they depict it as an essential ingredient in a mentally/physically engaging routine. As Newport says:  
> Put another way, trying to squeeze a little more work out of your evenings might reduce your effectiveness the next day enough that you end up getting less done than if you had instead respected a shutdown.

This *less-is-more* chorus may remind you of lesson #1: embrace boredom. However, while there I was advocating against the efficiency-is-the-key mindset, here I am advocating for a specific activity: resting.

Now, we finally go into what me and Newport have to suggest you.
