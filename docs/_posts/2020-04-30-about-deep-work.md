## Intro

This is my first book review, and it's also the first time I talk about productivity, therefore I think I'll spend two words on the context. <br>
I am a productivity freak. <br>
Productivity has always been a natural tendency of mine, but only during the last year it has grown into a conscious passion. I cannot remember what exactly drew me into this mindset, but the management of <i>time</i> has now a central role in my life. 

> Why do you obsess over time management? <br>

The honest answer is that I don't know. <br>
As I thought about it in the last minute three plausible reasons crossed my mind, but I guess that the basic idea is to *try to live most of the time up to my values*. <br>
As [Mark Manson](https://markmanson.net/) states in one of his precious podcast's episodes: 

> Every moment of every day, whether you realize it or not, you are making a decision on how to spend your time, on what to pay attention to, on where to direct your energy. <br>[...]
Our values are constantly reflected in the way we choose to behave.<br>

You may be asking: 
> But what has living up to ones values to do with productivity? <br>

To me, to Cal Newport, whose ideas I'm going to discuss in a bit, and to many others I believe, *productivity is the ability of getting stuff done*. And you can replace "stuff" with anything that you value. <br>
To phrase it in another way, *productivity is the ability of avoiding to spend (too much) time on activities that are do not add value to your life*. <br>
Going a step further, *productivity is a time-usage-aware lifestyle*.

Practically speaking though, **being productive is hard** and the reason is that there are many different obstacles along the way.<br>
As trivial as it may sound, the main obstacle standing in your way is yourself. Let me elaborate further on this. Increasing your productivity involves constantly adjusting your habits in a feedback loop fashion, and questioning your choices, and it requires <b>a ton of will power</b>. The most difficult skill that you need to learn is probably **self-awareness**, which is fundamental to have a grip on how you really use your day. If you are like me (and not just me probably) most of the time you're in *"<i>auto-pilot</i>"* mode. I came to realize only recently how easily my mind slips into an absorbed state from which it hardly recovers. Don't get me wrong, the ability to dive into any activity is one of the most powerful features of our brain. However, from a time-management perspective it is just as essential to be able to emerge from this <i>flow</i> before jumping into any new task to ask yourself : <i>is this the best way of spending my time right now?</i><br>
<br>


Back to me being a productivity freak and the reason why I've read <i>Deep work</i> by Cal Newport.<br> 
As I mentioned before, I have a natural inclination to optimization. I've started experimenting with productivity before I even knew there where people seriously discussing the idea. <br>
Nonetheless, the subject is not being given enough thought by the majority of people I know. And the reason, in my opinion, is that not many people have witnessed a significant improvement in the quality of their lives when applying some optimization techniques.<br> 
For what concerns my experience, I have to say that the effects of a carefully crafted routine have revealed to be definitely positive so far.<br> 
I hope to push you to try harder improving your schedule, and in the meanwhile I can share with you some of the productivity hacks that I've discovered along the way. <br> 

To conclude this already too long paragraph, I have been collecting <i>optimization heuristics</i> through the last 3-4 years, and only a few months ago I introduced myself to the public discourse on the subject, which offered me the chance to compare my findings to what other people had already discovered. <br>
Needless to say, everyone is different, and there's no such thing as a <i>one-size-fit-all productivity recipe</i> that you can just put on your daily schedule to become a productivity genius. Finding your optimal routine is ultimately about knowing yourself, i.e. acknowledging your values and your weaknesses, and about accepting that they can change. 



<br>
## The book

The previous sentence directly brings me to the main critique that I have to make to this book, so finally we start talking about what was supposed to be to topic of this article. <br>
The book is rich in concepts and is full of food for thought. However, in my opinion, Newport falls into what I would call the <i>details trap</i> when discussing a new concept. Let me elaborate further. His chapters follow a regular pattern: he starts by explaining the general idea, which he then develops by progressively zooming into it. This scheme probably aims at leaving the reader with as much guidance as possible when it comes to implementation. Going from the theory read in a book to the everyday practice is hard, especially if you're not given any material advice. Unfortunately, as I said before, productivity is a personal journey, and any attempt to shape it into a prescription is doomed to fail. My point is that such fine-grained descriptions of the dos and don'ts is useless if not dangerous. The reader will have to discover at his own expense that all these little tricks need to be patiently fine-tuned to match his life-style, his personality. <br>
What I've just claimed does not make reading about productivity a waste of time. I nonetheless consider Newport's concepts to be valuable and useful, and I've been experimenting with most of these ideas myself. <br>
This seems a good point to start diving into the cool stuff in this book.

#### 1. Embrace boredom
The first advice I want to spend a few words on is actually the second rule suggested by Newport: **embrace boredom**.<br>  
A natural measure for the quality of your planning is **efficiency**, which we can formally phrase as the number of goals accomplished per day, or -to leave some elasticity- the percentage of tasks closed per week. It follows that, armed with a better planning, you will never have to turn down opportunities, and hence as your scheduling ability improves, the number of projects you're simultaneously following should increase while you happily somehow manage to get all the work done.

During my second year as a bachelor student I would wake up early in the morning to get to my university around 9 am, and I would get out only after the last lesson, around 6 pm. I would then rush to be home around 7 pm, throw something digestible into my body as fast as I could (as an Italian I can't define that as "eating") and then head to the pub where I would serve beers and hamburgers until 1 am approximately. Sleep, repeat. This frenetic routine lasted around 6 months, during which I learned to use any free moment to study, regardless of the surroundings. The only available time to revise was while commuting to the uni and back every day. I would study on the train, on the underground, and even while crossing the street. Looking back I guess that those months exacerbated in me the feeling that time is scarce and that I shouldn't let any moment go wasted. 

There is a fallacy in this planning style, which I only had to come in terms with recently and which Cal Newport wisely addresses with this *rule number 2*. The problem stems from the fact that the mind easily develops addiction for *stimuli*, and anything that represents a distraction from your current occupation will come to you in form of a physical (visual, auditory, ...) *stimulus*. If you keep intensifying your routine and filling your calendar, maybe to the point where you start parallelizing to increase your efficiency as I did a few years back, your mind is going to adapt to a fast-rate working mode: you will probably start losing your patience easily; you will have a harder time resting, because your mind will be constantly craving for new inputs to process; and you could experience more frustration when attempting to work in a slow-rate or, to say it in the Newport style, a *deep* mode. <br>
> **Deep Work**: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skills, and are hard to replicate. 
###### Deep work, Introduction

Newport reserves an entire section of the book to argue the importance of the ability to work in a deep mode (chapter 1 to 3), contextualizing the need of this skill in the Internet era. <br>
He focuses on an intellectual kind of work, like the one he does, being an associate professor of computer science at Georgetown University. However, I believe we can extend the definition of Deep Work to a whole *attitude towards life*, which we could maybe call *Deep mode* and phrase as follows: 
> **Deep Mode**: A state of distraction-free concentration that keeps you fully immersed in your current activity. <br> 

What I here call *deep mode* is similar in spirit to what in positive psychology is known as [*the flow*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)) or *the zone*. Call it *Deep work* or *Deep mode* or even *Flow*, the problem is that focus does not get along well with a frenetic routine. 

[](https://web.archive.org/web/20131110043540/http://articlescoertvisser.blogspot.com/2007/11/good-business-leadership-flow-and.html)

This last point is the one upon which Newport builds his argument, depicting the ability to work in *a deep way* as essential to obtain a certain level of quality in your results, if not to get results at all. The problem is that a slow-rate working mode does not match a frenetic routine. The deep work settings usually require your brain to engage in a prolonged effort while receiving little to no rewards at all, with a few inputs that come in at a low frequency. As you might have noticed, reading a scientific article feels different from writing an e-mail, having a phone call or attending a conference. The reason is that you're using your brain at two fundamentally distinct rates.<br>
Even though it is hard to accept, we must face the truth, which is that we humans have limits, like the number of days we got left to live, or the length of the longest sequence of numbers that we can memorize. The number of activities you can commit to on each day is another example of limit, and there's no scheduling trick to escape this rule.<br> 
While jdhbfj you think you'll do more you actually end up doing less.
