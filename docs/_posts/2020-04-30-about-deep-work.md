## Intro
<div style="text-align: justify"> 

This is my first book review, and it's also the first time I talk about productivity, therefore I think I'll spend two words on the context. <br>
I am a productivity freak. At first being productive was just a natural tendency, but during the last year it has grown into a conscious passion. I cannot remember what exactly drew me into this mindset, but the management of <i>time</i> has a central role in my life. 
Why? <br>
The honest answer is that I don't know.
</div>
As I thought about it in the last minute at least three plausible reasons crossed my mind, but I guess that the basic idea is to live most of the time up to my values. As [Mark Manson](https://markmanson.net/) in one of his precious podcast's episodes states : 

> Every moment of every day, whether you realize it or not, you are making a decision on how to spend your time, on what to pay attention to, on where to direct your energy. <br>[...]
Our values are constantly reflected in the way we choose to behave.

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
You may be asking: what has living up to ones values to do with productivity? <br>
To me, to Cal Newport, whose ideas I'm going to discuss in a bit, and to many others I believe, *productivity means being able to get stuff done*. And you can replace "stuff" with anything that you value. To phrase it in another way, productivity means not losing time on things that are not important to you. Going a step further, being productive mean being being more aware of the usage of your time.

Practically speaking though, being productive is hard, and the reason is that there are many different obstacles along the way.<br>
It may sound trivial but <b>the main obstacle is you</b>. Becoming more productive involves constantly adjusting your habits, questioning your choices, and it requires <b>a ton of will power</b>. <br>The most difficult skill that you need to learn is probably self-awarness, which is a fundamental tool to have a grip on how you really use your day. If you are like me (and not just me probably) most of the time you're in "<i>auto-pilote</i>" mode. I came to realize only recently how easily my mind slips away from awareness into an absorbed state from which it hardly recovers. Don't get me wrong, to dive into any activity is a powerful feature of our brains, but in the process of increasing your productivity you need to be able to emerge from <i>the flow</i> and, before starting anything, ask yourself : <i>is this the best way of spending my time right now?</i>

Back to me being a productivity freak and the reason why I've read <i>Deep work</i> by Cal Newport. As I mentioned before, I have a natural inclination to optimization. I've started experimenting with productivity before I even knew there where people seriously discussing the idea. <br>Actually, from my experience the subject is not being given enough thought by the majority of people that I know. And the reason I believe is that not many people have experienced a significant improvement in the quality of their lives when applying some optimization techniques. I have instead so far enjoyed the benefits of a carefully crafted routine, and I hope to inspire you to try harder improving yours, while giving you some productivity hacks that I've discovered along the way. <br> To conclude this already too long paragraph, I have been collecting <i>optimization heuristics</i> through the last 3-4 years, and only a few months ago I introduced myself to the public discourse on the subject, which offered me the chance to compare my findings to what other people had already discovered. <br>
Needless to say, everyone is different, and there's no such thing as a <i>one-size-fit-all productivity recipe</i> that you can just carefully follow to become more productive. Finding your optimal routine is ultimately about knowing yourself, i.e your values and your weaknesses, and about accepting that they can change.

## On Deep work

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
The previous sentence directly brings me to the main critique that I have to make to this book, so finally we start talking about what was supposed to be to topic of this article. <br>
The book is rich in concepts and is full of food for thought. However, to develop a concept Newport often falls into the <i>details trap</i>.
