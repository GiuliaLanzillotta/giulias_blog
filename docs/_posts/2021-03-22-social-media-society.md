## Outline 
1. Nosedive, the Social Dilemma, and our future
- Nosedive is an episode from black mirror ... apparent dystopic future where ... how distant from our reality? 
>The majority of the episodes centre on the grim effects of the dominance of future technologies over human life and present warnings about a future that might be just around the corner. Consequently, the series is read as a depiction of the ‘consequences of unchecked techno-capitalism’ on the lives of individuals in ‘a futuristic, dystopian projection’ of the present.
- Maybe social dilemma here 
- The question here is where are we going? is there any space for social media in a future society? what will it look like?

Is social media affecting mental health?

- The relationship between digital technology and mental health has been investigated from many perspective.
- These two papers conduct a review of the research on the topic, agreeing on the presence of both benefits and drawbacks related to social media use. 

        The evidence reviewed here is largely inconclusive with respect to impact on children’s physical activity, but indicates that digital technology seems to be beneficial for children’s social relationships. In terms of impact on children’s mental well-being, the most robust studies suggest that the relationship is U-shaped, where no use and excessive use can have a small negative impact on mental well-being, while moderate use can have a small positive impact.

        Today’s children and adolescents are immersed in both traditional and new forms of digital media. Research on traditional media, such as television, has identified health concerns and negative outcomes that correlate with the duration and content of viewing. Over the past decade, the use of digital media, including interactive and social media, has grown, and research evidence suggests that these newer media offer both benefits and risks to the health of children and teenagers. Evidence-based benefits identified from the use of digital and social media include early learning, exposure to new ideas and knowledge, increased opportunities for social contact and support, and new opportunities to access health promotion messages and information. Risks of such media include negative health effects on sleep, attention, and learning; a higher incidence of obesity and depression; exposure to inaccurate, inappropriate, or unsafe content and contacts; and compromised privacy and confidentiality.

- Recently, concerns have been expressed by researchers, clinicians and the public in regard to apparent compulsive behaviours of digital media users. In this recent review evidence for strong correlation of screentime and obesity and higher depressive symptoms was found. 

        We found moderately strong evidence for associations between screentime and greater obesity/adiposity and higher depressive symptoms; moderate evidence for an association between screentime and higher energy intake, less healthy diet quality and poorer quality of life. There was weak evidence for associations of screentime with behaviour problems, anxiety, hyperactivity and inattention, poorer self-esteem, poorer well-being and poorer psychosocial health, metabolic syndrome, poorer cardiorespiratory fitness, poorer cognitive development and lower educational attainments and poor sleep outcomes. 
        There is evidence that higher levels of screentime is associated with a variety of health harms for CYP, with evidence strongest for adiposity, unhealthy diet, depressive symptoms and quality of life. Evidence to guide policy on safe CYP screentime exposure is limited.

- In a study conducted by royal society of public mental health again social media platforms were associated with both positive and negative effects on the well-being of young individuals. 

    	- Potential negative effects: 
		○ anxiety: One in six young people will experience an anxiety disorder at some point in their lives and identified rates of anxiety and depression in young people have increased by 70% over the past 25 years. Compare and despair attitude
		○ Depression: the intensity of the online world - where teens and young adults are constantly contactable, face pressures from unrealistic representations of reality, and deal with online peer pressure - may be responsible for triggering depression or exacerbating existing conditions 
		○ Sleep quality: Numerous studies have shown that increased social media use has a significant association with poor sleep quality in young people - https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308903222_Social_media_use_fear_of_missing_out_and_sleep_outcomes_in_adolescence
		○ body image
		○ cyber-bullying: Ensuring our young people are safe from abuse online via social media must be a top priority for parents, schools and social media companies. 
		○ FoMO: In essence, FoMO is the worry that social events, or otherwise enjoyable activities, may be taking place without you present to enjoy them. FoMO is characterised by the need to be constantly connected with what other people are doing, so as not to miss out. FoMO is associated with lower mood and lower life satisfaction.
	    - Potential positive effects: 
		○ access to other people's experiences: feeling understood. the act of learning about others’ health experiences may be hugely beneficial to those experiencing health issues themselves. Measures to ensure information is credible and can be trusted by young people would need to be in place before social media is used as a means to spread official health information
		○ emotional support and community building: Sharing problems or issues with friends, peers and broader social networks can be met with positive reaction. Nearly seven in 10 teens report receiving support on social media during tough or challenging times. By joining ‘groups’ or ‘pages’ young people can surround themselves with like-minded people and share their thoughts or concerns. These groups may be minorities in the real world, but can build online communities that provide a safe network for young people, such as those from the LGBTQ+ community or ethnic minorities that are at higher risk for compromised mental health. 
		○ self expression and identity: They are able to personalise their profiles and feeds with images, videos and words that express who they are and how they identify with the world around them. 
		○ maintaining and building relationships: strong adolescent friendships can be enhanced by social media interaction, allowing young people to create stronger bonds with people they already know. Social media can also act as a ‘second phase’ of interaction after an initial face-to-face encounter with someone new. This means even the most brief interactions can be continued via social media whereas these relationships may have otherwise been lost. 

- A report published in Clinical Psychological Science in 2018 featured two cross-sectional surveys of 506,820 American high school students, and found that use of digital media was associated with higher rates of depressive symptoms and suicidality

        In two nationally representative surveys of U.S. adolescents in grades 8 through 12 (N = 506,820) and national statistics on suicide deaths for those ages 13 to 18, adolescents’ depressive symptoms, suicide-related outcomes, and suicide rates increased between 2010 and 2015, especially among females. Adolescents who spent more time on new media (including social media and electronic devices such as smartphones) were more likely to report mental health issues, and adolescents who spent more time on nonscreen activities (in-person social interaction, sports/exercise, homework, print media, and attending religious services) were less likely.

-  A 2018 review published in Nature considered that young people may have different experiences online, depending on their socio-economic background, noting lower-income youths may spend up to three hours more per day using digital devices, compared to higher-income youths. They theorised that lower-income youths, who are already vulnerable to mental illness, may be more passive in their online engagements, being more susceptible to negative feedback online, with difficulty self-regulating their digital media use. It concluded that this may be a new form of digital divide between at-risk young people and other young people, pre-existing risks of mental illness becoming amplified among the already vulnerable population



Can we rethink the present to shape the future? Use Twitter to get flying cars? 

In the history of humanity we have been repeating the same mistake over and over again: we inhumanely exploit other people blinded by our self-interest, forgetting that they too can feel and think just like we do. The Spanish colonisation of the Americas in the 16th century is a blatant example of this natural tendency to brutality: it is estimated that around 8 million indigenous people died to the hand of European conquistadores, on the search for land and gold. What has happened in the last 20 years makes no exception: the only difference now is that everyone is getting exploited, even those who profit from it. The modest success of early Social Media sites were the equivalent of Columbus discovery: a new land had just been uncovered, promising to make reach the first digital conquistador daring to conquer it. I believe that just like Columbus, the tech companies did not understand true nature of the change they were about to bring.  

“there was not much thought given to the long-term negative consequences of developing such a platform.” This is exactly the problem with our increased pace of innovation. These companies are too worried about pushing hot new technologies and beating competitors to market so they often times do not look at the long-term effects it could have on society.

## Intro & 2 questions
<div align="justify">
Welcome back old readers and welcome to the new ones. In this post I'm going to talk about an increasingly hot topic these days: social media and the consequences of social media consumption on YOUR mental health. <br> Who am I to tell you anything about social media? I'm just a user actually, probably not more an expert on the matter than you. But knowing what I've been doing in the past few weeks may encourage you to read on (not that I have any personal interest in stealing 10 minutes of your life dear reader). Well, I've been digging around looking for information, carefully checked my sources, studied the material, watched some funny Youtube videos, answered to emails, scrolled over my Facebook news feed, summarised everything for you and added a few pictures. Convinced now? 
<br>
<br>
Here's an overview of what I am going to cover in this article: 
<br>
<ol>
<li> We start with a brief history of social media</li> 
<li> Move on to a few statistics to impress you with things you already know </li>
<li> Then we finally discuss what researchers are currently saying on the relationship between social media consumption and mental health</li>
<li> And lastly we ask ourselves what an ethical alternative to Facebook (to name one) would look like</li>
</ol>
Before we begin I want to ask you two questions. I'm asking them now because I would like you to have these questions in the back of your head throughout this read and ideally at the end we'll try to sketch an answer. As it happens in many cases, the questions are more important than the answer. <br><br>
 </div>
> Is there a place for social media in an ideal future society?
> If yes, in what form?

You've got them, keep them there.
