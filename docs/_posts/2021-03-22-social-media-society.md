How did social media as we know them today come to be? What would the world have been like if social media platforms had never been invented? Or was social media an unavoidable step in the evolution of the human species? In this blog post we ask these questions, examining the history of social media to understand its future.<!--more--> 
<br>
<br>
That of social media has been a revolution of unprecedented scale in human history. No technology ever developed, not even vaccines, has so radically penetrated the daily routine of half of the world (4.20 billion active social media users have been reported in 2021 <a href="https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2021-global-overview-report">[1]</a>). And social media has accomplished the deed in less than 20 years. We will see that the roots of this phenomenon trace back to the early stages of the information era (late 1960s), however I can anticipate to you that it is not before 2003 that we see the first signs of what has been an unforseen siege of society. Despite all the critiques that may be moved to it, the development of social media remains remarkable in its proportions and in this context it is undoubtedly fascinating. <br>
The growth of social media cannot be explained by any tangible need: social media cannot be compared to agricultural or industrial technologies in this regard. One may even say that it cannot be compared with its closest partners, i.e. mobile phones and laptops. Having to choose between the two, keeping either the invention of social media or that of mobile phones and laptops, we would probably all pick the latter: both mobile phones and laptops appear to possess the character of necessity that social media platforms simply lack. More to the strange case of the sudden spread of this mania on a blue and green planet rolling along somewhere in the Milky way: there was no political intention or careful planning of its development. Put in another way, the world population did not ask for social media: like any catastrophe, it just happened. Really, governments and the public service were probably the last piece of society to hop on the wagon. In hindsight, the development of social media can be regarded as part of the natural course of existence of a capitalistic and technologically prepared society as ours in the early 2000s. In fact, although the process that brought our 'social society' to be may seem completely erratic and extraneous to our nature, we will see that it fundamentally relies on primary instincts common to every human being and thus that its explanation is rather trivial. But now let us dive into the facts!

<h2> 1. The origins </h2>

Social media as we know it today has almost nothing to do with its origins. It was born as a very exclusive activity: most of its users had to be serious computer hobbyists or commercial clients because the system required rather complex skills to be operated. Many of you will know that the very first connectivity effort - that eventually led to the birth of this magic place called <i>The Internet</i> - was part of a U.S. Department of Defence project (known as <i>ARPANET</i>) whose aim was to connect universities on a proto-internet. Yes, thank the cold war happened if you're enjoying this article. [A small side note (spoiler alert): perhaps some of you will find interesting noting that the motivations behind two of the big steps forward in this story (ARPANET being the first, Facebook the second) both belong to the university world.] The project, started in 1962, produced its first message in 1969: funnily enough the message sent was simply "LO" instead of the intended word "LOGIN" as the system crashed halfway through <a href="https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?entryid=1108">[2]</a>. Albeit of fundamental importance to this story ARPANET cannot be considered part of it, simply because it is missing one of the most characteristic feature of "socials": to be used during free time, as a form of entertainment. The first non-military computer-based community was born 10 years later, in 1978, when the Computerized Bulletin Board System (CBBS) ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system)) was created. Its authors, Ward Christensen and Randy Suess, thought of it as an electronic version of the type of bulletin board found on the wall of many work places: the main purpose of the technology was to post simple messages between users. The BBS became the primary kind of online community through the 1980s and early 1990s, before the World Wide Web arrived. An old [documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESaTREAAzww), apparently produced in 1992 by Roy Janke, can help our imagination, for those of us who cannot remember these times. Using a BBS was never easy: although a GUI (graphical user interface) was introduced and then bettered through the years, users had to be professional system operators, and accessing boards was expensive as it was subject to long-distance phone charges. The most advanced BBS offered uploading and downloading functions for software and data, news and bulletins reading and message exchanges with other users through public message boards, and in some cases via direct chatting. At its peak, this technology supported 60 thousand platforms serving 17 million users in the U.S. For some people this was a hobby, but for the most this was a rather unappealing way to spend your free time (like, say, home brewing).

<h2> 2. Before Friendster: the '90s </h2>

<br>

Fast-forward 20 years. We're in the 90's and the World Wide Web is born thanks to a British researcher (Tim Berners-Lee , <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Wikepedia</a>) working at CERN in Switzerland. As an increasing number of people was gaining access to the Internet (thanks to the advent of commercial personal computers and their widening market, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_personal_computers">Wikipedia</a>) a plethora of precursors of social media sites were born. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities"><i>Yahoo! Geocieties</i></a> (1994-2009), originally called the <i>Beverly Hills Internet</i>, allowed users to create and publish websites for free and to browse the other user-created websites. In 1999 it was supposedly the third-most visited website on the World Wide Web. What made GeoCities unique was its original organisation of the user-generated content into cities: for example, computer-related sites where displayed in "Silicon Valley" and those dealing with entertainment were assigned to "Hollywood" - hence the name of the site. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SixDegrees.com"><i>Sixdegrees</i></a> (1997-2001) arrived a few years later but eventually acquired an equivalently wide popularity. The name refers to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation"><i>six degrees of separation</i></a> concept, attributed to the Hungarian author Frigyes Karinthy, according to which all the people in the world are 6 or fewer social connections away from each other. On the website, users were asked to list friends, family members and acquaintances (which would then be invited to join the site too) and, in addition to the possibility of exchanging messages and bulletins with the users in their closest circles, they could see their connection to any other user on the site. Another noteworthy example is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIM_(software)"><i>AOL Instant Messenger</i></a> (1997-2017), abbreviated AIM. Its main distinguishing feature was the exceptionally advanced instant messaging technology, which allowed users to communicate in real time. Over the years it developed a list of useful features, some of which form the skeleton of today's messaging apps. To name a few: the <i>buddy list</i>, user profiles, voice chat and file transfer. The website reached 18 million users at its peak. [Side note: on <a href="https://mashable.com/archive/aim-history#0KWK53Xu8gqN">Mashable</a> you can find an in-depth look at the rather controversial history of AIM.]

Many other sites blossomed during these years, sharing more or less the same characteristics. Why so many? Most of these platforms were offering forum-like discussions, where to talk about particular topics with complete strangers, and minimal user profiles, where you could insert one or two pictures and enter a few personal details. In a nutshell, <b>social media were boring at this time</b>: after having completed your registration and maybe invited your friends there wasn’t much you could do. My guess is that most of the people would just keep re-iterating this process on a different website, enjoying the small variation in style and functionality. This could explain why so many similar platforms were created in such a short period of time. 

<div align="center" >

<br>

The most popular websites at the time were instead offering a very different user experience, often answering specific user's needs. Among them, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LiveJournal">Live Journal</a> (1999-) offered web-hosting services for users interested in blogging: differentiating it from the rest was its open and customizable writing format. Perhaps funnily, it was started by the American programmer Brad Fitzpatrick to keep his high school friends updated on his activities and it ended up becoming the main blogging tool in Russia. In 2006 the website was sold to a Russian company, which still owns it today. <a href="https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/postscript/whatever-happened-livejournal/">The history of the web</a> writes in detail on the story of this website and its bizarre ties to the early 2000s international politics. <br>
On a different note, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napster">Napster</a> (1999-) was a file-sharing network specifically designed for music files (in MP3 format). Many platforms were already offering file-sharing, but Napster stood out for its focus on music, its user-friendly interface and its rather unusual choice to rely on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer">peer-to-peer</a> sharing technology (the same in use by most pirate websites today). Napster opened the 'world of music' to the world, by and large anticipating the streaming media services that today form an integral part of the average digital routine. The platform registered an instant success, reaching 80 million users at the height of its popularity. Its service didn't last long, however, due to the numerous lawsuits (from music giants like <i>Metallica</i> and <i>Dr. Dre</i>) over the unauthorised spread of copyrighted material that started raining on its 3 young authors (brothers Shawn and John Fanning, along with Sean Parker) immediately after its release. But most failed to see that Napster had initiated a revolution that would radically transform the music industry in the following years. Between 2000 and 2010 music sales in the U.S. dropped 47 percent [ <a>source</a> ]. Finally, after a long court battle, the RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America) obtained an injunction from the courts that forced Napster to shut down its network in 2001. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L23UJfvptd8">This old tape</a> from Headline News captured the public sentiment on the phenomenon at the time.) The following year, the website was sold to the digital media company Roxio, and transformed into an online PressPlay music store. [Side note: in 2003 Apple released the <i>iTunes Store</i>, in 2006 <i>Spotify</i> was founded in Sweden. It took the music industry 10-15 years to figure out how to profit from the 'Napster model': sometimes timing is essential.] 

In summary, at the end of the '90s social media were growing, albeit still a niche, phenomenon. [not interesting for business - importantly, you couldn't earn a lot from social media] To allow a comparison with the revolution that followed, I'm leaving here a few digits relative to the years between '94 and '99: 
- Internet users rose from 16 to 248 million
- In '97 a social media breaks the 1 million active users record
- SixDegrees reaches 3.5 million users

 <h2> 3. The Friendster revolution</h2>

<br>

We're in 2002 and the Canadian programmer Jonathan Abrams has founded a new social media platform called <i>Friendster</i>. Its name derived from the two words "friend" and (yes, you guessed it) Napster, and it offered scant user profiles, personal chats and music sharing. All in all, its features were not new: they had already been previously implemented and were available on various other websites. What happened next is probably going to surprise you. Friendster became the largest growing business in the history of social media at the time, breaking all the records, and arguably inaugurating a new era. Officially launched in 2003, it reached <b>3 million users within the first few months</b>. Mr. Abrams suddenly found himself on the cover of multiple magazines and interviewed on late-night talk shows, while publications including <i>Time</i>, <i>Esquire</i>, <i>Vanity Fair</i>, <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>, <i>Us Weekly</i> and <i>Spin</i> were writing about Friendster's success. For the first time since their appearance on the web, social media platforms had turned a nerdy Mr. anybody into a rich and famous entrepreneur: what had started as a niche, unpopular pastime activity for computer hobbyists had now entered the room of serious businesses (to stay). In 2003 <i>Google</i> offered $30 million (in Google stock) to buy out Friendster: Mr. Abrams turned down the offer. But the platform was not ready to bear its own success: Friendster had major technology problems (as the same Abrams tells in <a href="https://mashable.com/archive/jonathan-abrams-friendster-facebook#pTATxDsfriqg">an interview</a>); "people could barely log into the website for two years". Friendster was destined to be drowned by the gigantic wave it itself had started a few years later. In 2011 Friendster was transformed into a social gaming platform, to be definitively shut down in 2015. The story of Friendster is a bitter testament to missed opportunities and lack of vision: had he acknowledged on time the potential of his small venture, Jonathan Abrams could have gone down history as one of the world's most successful tech founders. 

A 19 yo college student from New York instead understood the opportunities hanging from the social media tree and moved quick to seize them. The race to overtake this newfound market had officially started.  


 <h2> 4. After Friendster: today</h2>

Most of the readers will have personally witnessed the remaining part of this story. In the span of two calendar years the social media market experienced a growth that had taken decades to unfold in other business sectors. Between 2003 and 2005 a number of tech-giants-to-be such as <i>MySpace</i>, <i>LinkedIn</i>, <i>Second Life</i>, <i>Flickr</i>, <i>Facebook</i>, <i>Youtube</i> and <i>Reddit</i> were founded. Most interestingly, the way users interacted with social media websites underwent a fundamental shift, and with it the collective perception of these new web services changed. Suddenly, more and more people began spending hours every day on once boring websites. During the second half of the 00s the foundations for the imperishable success of social media were laid: multiple platforms started experimenting with new features built to <b>maximise the user's engagement</b>, capitalising on innocent results from psychology research. To his merit, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg">Mark Zuckerberg</a> was the first to discover and develop many of the ingredients that would make social media companies dangerously powerful. [It is natural to wonder at this point whether social media would have been the same had Mark Zuckerberg decided to spend his life selling ice cream instead.] A 2019 study [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6679162/">3</a>] published on the <i>International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health</i> has analysed the main psychological mechanisms responsible for creating addiction to social media: 
<!-- Quoting the authors: 
 As the current business model of many app-developers foresees an exchange of personal data for allowance to use an app, <u>it is not surprising that many design elements can be found in social media apps and Freemium games prolonging app usage</u>.
--> 
most of the addictive features discussed in this study were first introduced on the platforms between 2006 and 2009. In the dedicated section below I will present these features and the underlying addictive mechanism in detail. But let me first draw your attention to a few key events marking this historical period for social media and tech businesses (i.e. the years between 2005 and 2010):

1. In <u>January 2007</u>, <i>Apple Computer</i> introduced the <i>iPhone</i> [<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2007/01/09Apple-Reinvents-the-Phone-with-iPhone/">Apple's article</a>], the first smartphone that would revolutionize the mobile phones' market (previous attempts at smartphones had not been as successful, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone#Early_smartphones">Wikipedia</a>). Unintentionally, smartphones played a crucial role in the evolution of social media: my guess is that Facebook would not have become the business giant it is today if it hadn't had the chance to move into our pockets and follow us around. [Unrelated side note: do you remember the cost of the first iPhone? $499, in its less expensive version.]

2. In <u>November 2007</u> Facebook introduces <i>Facebook Ads</i> [<a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2007/11/facebook-unveils-facebook-ads/">Facebook's article</a>], an advertising system allowing businesses to create individual profiles, mimicking the functions of a standard user. Before that, Facebook had reluctantly incorporated ads into empty screen spaces (the service was known as <i>Facebook Flyer</i> and it was introduced as early as only 2 months after the foundation). The difference between the two approaches was fundamental: using Zuckerberg's words at the Facebook Ads' official launch <i>"For the last hundred years, media has been pushed out to people, but now marketers are going to be a part of the conversation."</i>

3. In <u>April 2010</u> Marck Zuckerberg announces <i>GraphAPI v1.0</i> at the Facebook F8 conference [<a href="https://www.cnet.com/culture/facebook-f8-one-graph-to-rule-them-all/">CNET article</a>], an interface that accomplishes two feats: on one hand it lets the users access most websites and apps with their Facebook identity (the great "login with Facebook"); on the other hand it allows the sites' developers to directly collect information on their users from their Facebook profiles. Sounds like a win-win. The API release was met with enthusiasm by most web services [<a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2010/04/facebook-graph-api/">source</a>], which would advertise it as a step forward in the spirit of "web openness": '<i>openness of data means that developers can build innovative products based on APIs that weren’t previously possible</i>' says <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2010/04/why-f8-was-good-for-the-open-w.html">David Recordon</a>, ex head of Facebook Engineering, Director of Technology at the White House since 2021. Basically, once authorised with a single innocent-looking prompt, any website or app could retrieve, store and process people's data (posts, likes, pictures, ... ) - including that of their friends' network - theoretically <u>forever</u>. It was an unacknowledged revolution in large-scale data provision, marking a fundamental shift in social media's business model: from ads- to data- centered. The scraped data allowed multiple businesses to deliver targeted advertising and, in general, transformed social media into a powerful instrument of social control, as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook–Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal#Data_use">Cambridge Analytica scandal</a> would later prove. In my opinion, the release of the first Graph API can be regarded as the birth of modern social media: welcome to the era of low-key mass manipulation! Facebook eventually closed the Graph API v1.0 in 2014, promising to "put people first" in future platform developments (<a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2014/04/f8-2014-stability-for-developers-and-more-control-for-people-in-apps/">Facebook's announcement</a>).

<h3> Addictive features in social media today</h3>

<h4> Endless Scrolling/Streaming and the Concept of Flow </h4>
You may not remember it, but Facebook pages used to have an end. <i>Aza Raskin</i> invented endless (or infinite) scrolling in 2006, when he was working at <i>Humanized</i>, a company focused on improving user-experience on webpages. In a presentation (still available in some <a href="https://youtu.be/EuELwq2ThJE">remote corner</a> of the web) held for the <i>Google Blogger</i> team he pitches the idea behind this new feature as follows: "<i>don't force users to ask for more content, just give it to them</i>". Today Mr. Raskin regrets his invention. Quoting from one of his <a href="https://twitter.com/aza/status/1138268959982022656?lang=en">tweets</a>: "<i>One of my lessons from infinite scroll: that optimizing something for ease-of-use does not mean best for the user or humanity.</i>". In 
2013 he co-founded the <a href="https://www.humanetech.com">Center for Humane technology</a>, a nonprofit organisation dedicated to radically reimagining the digital infrastructure. 

<h4>Endowment Effect/Mere Exposure Effect</h4>
The <i>endowment effect</i> is generally defined as the increase of the perceived value of a product after its purchase. Simply put, the more you invest in something, the more that thing matters to you. Translated in the context of social media, the endowment effect increases the interests of the users in the platform as the platform is being used (e.g. chatting, discovering news or modifying one's profile). For a familiar example of the effect in action think of <i>Instagram</i>: after sharing a new <i>Instagram story</i> or <i>Instagram post</i> the user is more likely to come back to the platform than the usual. Both ownership and loss aversion are discussed as reasons for the endowment effect. The <i>exposure effect</i> often works in conjunction with the endowment effect: simply, the increase in familiarity with the service leads to increased user enjoyment. These two mechanisms naturally play in favour of user engagement as the usage time goes up: the real challenge for social media companies was persuading the user to <i>come back to the platform</i> often enough. 

<h4>Social Pressure</h4>
Feeling compelled to answer a text because of the read receipt, or peaking at the message from the notification bar to avoid committing to an answer are both good examples of <i>social pressure</i> at work, the third mechanism mentioned in the study. It spontaneously emerges when both sides know the rules of the scenario. For example, both parties are likely to expect an answer to arrive shortly after a message has been read: in this way social pressure nudges the users of messaging apps towards faster communication. Likewise, sending one text often bears on the user an unacknowledged commitment to a dialogue for the following 5-10 minutes (translating into more usage), especially since when social media moved from the desktops into the users' pockets. This principle has first been put to use by Apple in 2011 [see the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrBIgjodpFs">keynote</a>], followed by Facebook in 2012 [<a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/facebook-messenger-updated-with-read-receipts/">source</a>], albeit with an essential difference between the two: Apple <i>iMessage</i> read receipts were optional, Facebook <i>Messenger</i>'s weren't (see <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/17/message-read-but-what-kind-of-weirdo-keeps-read-receipts-on">this article</a>). Interestingly, <i>WhatsApp</i> introduced read receipts in 2014, the same year it was acquired by Facebook. 

<h4>Show Users of an App What They Like</h4>
Undoubtedly, Facebook's most successful bet has been its visionary <i>NewsFeed</i>, which during the years has housed masterful engineering efforts, often advancing the state-of-the-art technologies on automatic profiling and natural language data analysis. The platform didn't have a NewsFeed until 2006. Before its introduction people would have to intentionally navigate to their friends' personal pages to see their updates: basically the site was little more than a directory of names, interests and contact information (difficult to picture today, right?). The new feed tool simply reorganised and summarised the recent updates from the user's friend list, displaying them in a compact way on the new website landing page: it was meant to spare the users from the hustle of having to tour all their friends' personal pages to get an overview of 'what's going on'. Remarkably, when it first came out, the NewsFeed was met with a lot of indignation from the platform [the popular opinion at the time was perfectly captured by <a href="https://www.wired.com/2006/09/facebook-faces-backlash/">Wired</a>]. The reason is that users were feeling exposed, every small update being automatically showcased to their entire friends' list. [A small clarification is of essence here: the news shared on the feed corresponded to what was already made available to the public on the personal profiles, no private information was being discloses.] 
Funnily, in response to the general unrest founder Mark Zuckerberg wrote a blog post called "<i>Calm down. Breathe. We hear you</i>" [<a href="https://mashable.com/archive/facebook-news-feed-evolution">Mashable</a>], but the News Feed stayed. 

During the years, what was an innocent website reorganisation would become the powerhouse of the company's most lucrative plans. After the introduction of the <i>Like button</i> in 2009, Facebook began developing algorithms to automatically select and organise the information available to the user. The selection would be based on the user's taste, inferred from the personal 'like' records, the traces left on the website (e.g. the time spent where) and the analysis of the emotional content of the posts being read. The NewsFeed was tailored to each individual user, displaying the platform's content in decreasing order of estimated engagement. As pointed out in a recent study [<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702174?casa_token=RbEdLOHRdesAAAAA:tQv_3T11hJRD9KpN8pp1k0f2InsKErsrN3Co9Qju_vQMV7hs2vOZ2ccA3IS6DHCnOK0yYWzNClVxIm4">4</a>], with time and the increasing sophistication of the profiling algorithms, social media users became increasingly reliant on the automatic selection of the platforms' content, often ignoring the underlying process. In other words, social media users today are less capable of filtering their content than their predecessors. We could deem the so-called <i>personalised NewsFeed</i> an additional service to the users, sparing them the time to go through posts that they would anyway find tedious. But the real gain is in for the platform: by excluding potentially boring content from its feed, Facebook significantly reduced the incentive to leave the website. <i>Showing people what they like</i> is the fourth addictive feature discussed in the study and definitely among the most powerful ones implemented on social media platforms today. 

<h4>Social Comparison and Social Reward</h4>
The final mechanism to be mentioned in the study is the pair <i>social comparison</i> - <i>social reward</i>.
Social reward is what you experience when someone 'likes' your Facebook post or 'hearts' your new Instragram picture. This positive social feedback feature too was pioneered by Facebook (although some allegations suggest that it had been first introduced on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FriendFeed">Friendfeed</a>), with the <i>Like button</i> launched in 2009 (official launch <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/10160195053101729/">blog post</a>), although the project had been first developed internally in 2007, under the name "Awesome feature" (<a href="https://www.quora.com/Facebook-company/Whats-the-history-of-the-Awesome-Button-that-eventually-became-the-Like-button-on-Facebook">on Quora</a> you can read the inside story of the feature development). Multiple neuroscience studies have demonstrated a significant addictive component in social reward mechanisms like the Like button [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28612930/">5</a>,<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28442353/">6,<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25467383/">7</a>], especially among adolescents [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27247125/">8</a>]. [Side note: funnily enough, one of the five creators of the Like button, Justin Rosenstein, later deleted the Facebook app over addiction fears (see this <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/facebook-like-inventor-deletes-app-iphone-justin-rosenstein-addiction-fears-a7986566.html">Independent article</a>)]. <i>Social comparison</i> also plays a fundamental role in increasing social media app usage. The term refers to the <i>tendency of using other people as sources of information to determine how we are doing relative to others, or how we should behave, think, and feel</i> [<a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=A%20theory%20of%20social%20comparison%20processes&publication_year=1954&author=L.%20Festinger">9</a>]. A study by the University of Toledo [<a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3749094440774900767&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5">10</a>] found an association between social media usage and self-esteem, with higher usage in a context of <i>upward comparison</i> being correlated to low self-esteem. Sadly, social comparison is a natural human instinct, and the unique opportunity of comparison offered by social media platforms promptly made them essential instruments of our social life. As of today, not having a Facebook, Instagram or Twitter account can pose a serious threat to the social fitness of an individual, especially earlier in life. In summary, social comparison and social reward can trigger psychologically dangerous spirals that progressively compel the oblivious user to revisit the platform.

The effects of the masterful albeit quiet transformation that social media underwent between 2005 and 2010 can be read off the many statistics on digital products published every year. <a hrefs="https://datareportal.com">DataReportal</a> is one good source for such statistics, providing a variety of free reports every year which can offer insightful new perspectives on the digital phenomena that we are contributing to create. Let's look at some numbers.

- According to the <a href="https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2022-global-overview-report">2022 global overview report</a> there are <b>4.62 billion</b> active social media users today, 424 million of which (10.1%) joined only in 2021. That sums up to 58.4% of the global population, a percentage that goes up to 74.8% when you exclude all those younger than 13. 
- The number of people using social media has grown by <b>211%</b> in the last 10 years. 
- On average the internet user aged 16 to 64 spends <b>2h and 27 a day</b> on social media today, compared to 1h and 37m in 2013. [How much is too much? <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/bbc_future/status/951056270160744448">BBC Future</a> polled its followers on this question.]
- In case you're wondering, Facebook still ranks first with respect to the number of global active users, Youtube and WhatsApp ranking second and third respectively.
- 3 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms">Meta</a> platforms occupy the top three places in the "favourite" social media platform rankings. In decreasing order: WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook. Interestingly, the exceptionally growing platform TikTok ranks only 6th in this classification despite being the most downloaded app of 2021.
- The latest data suggest that TikTok has been adding an average of more than 650,000 new users every day over the first 3 months of 2022, which equates to almost <b>8 new users every second</b>.

The matter gets more bizarre if we look at the phenomenon from a slightly wider perspective. According to the Global Digital Reports's estimates, if the digital trends of the past year are maintained, the human species will globally total more than <b>12.5 trillion hours</b> online in 2022. All the way from bacteria, fishes and apes to get to digital freaks: what a spectacular evolutionary journey. But there's more to be amazed at. A <a href="https://techjury.net/blog/how-much-data-is-created-every-day/#gref">TechJury</a> report informs us that we produced <b>2.5 quintillion</b> (add 18 zeros) data bytes <u>per day</u> in 2020: we just can't help posting that brand new picture. Consider this: the human species is directing the efforts of some of the best engineers on the planet on the design of efficient storage facilities for an ever increasing number of pictures to be floating around the web (e.g. see the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Compute_Project">Open Compute Project</a>). In the words of PayPal co-founder <a href="https://som.yale.edu/blog/peter-thiel-at-yale-we-wanted-flying-cars-instead-we-got-140-characters">Peter Thiel</a>: 

> <i>We wanted flying cars and instead we got Twitter</i>.  

Is this the best usage of our resources, really? <br>
We are in what has been termed the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettabyte_Era">Zettabyte Era</a>, with <b>30-40 Zettabytes</b> (21 zeros) of data produced in total up to today (and we only started production less than 60 years ago). To ground the numbers in real life, a <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/executive-perspectives/annual-internet-report/index.html#~resources">Cisco report</a> from 2016 estimated that in 2021 it would take one person <b>5 million years</b> to watch the entirety of video traversing global IP networks <b>in one month</b>. In other words, in our lifetime each one of us will only explore an infinitely small percentage of the information that is being generated every second [I like to picture it as if every one was standing in their own little corner of the web, staring at the wall]. Nonetheless, we keep creating new content, and, most dramatically, <u>storing</u> it. In 2018, data centers were estimated to consume 2.7% of the EU electricity demand (<a href="https://www.dw.com/en/data-centers-energy-consumption-steady-despite-big-growth-because-of-increasing-efficiency/a-60444548">source</a>), and 1% of the global electricity demand (<a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/data-centres-and-data-transmission-networks">source</a>), numbers that we can only expect to grow in the following years. Internet (and especially social media) users seldom consider the cost of their digital products: every interaction with an app or website leaves traces (every access, 'reaction', message, picture, video, ... the list is long), which means that in a data center rack somewhere in the world that information will regularly absorb some electricity to be preserved. Your data will be stored until you decide to delete it. And if you don't want to delete it, it will stay there 'forever'. So far we haven't really faced the question of <i>how many forevers</i> it is actually possible to store. It is easy to see that this model will have to change at some point, and our now forevers will find their end.

#### Is spending time on social media bad for us?

Before leaping into Tomorrow and giving into the pleasures of imagination, there is one last data point that I'd like to introduce into this discussion. In a 2017 <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2017/12/hard-questions-is-spending-time-on-social-media-bad-for-us/">blog post</a> Facebook addresses what it describes as a 'hard question': <i>is spending time on social media bad for us</i>? Let's try to answer it. 
<div align="center" >

<br>
This question first emerged in the scientific literature relatively late (around 2014, e.g. <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11920-015-0629-2">this article</a>). Since then an increasing number of studies have been exploring the effects of social media use (SMU) on mental health, especially focusing on the most vulnerable section of the population: children and adolescents. Remarkably, the past couple of years have witnessed an acceleration in this trend (more empirical studies and respective reviews are being published) [coincidentally with the spread of the coronavirus pandemic]. <br> 
Interestingly, conclusions are not so easily drawn. Many studies seemingly contradict each other: some claim to have found a strong link between screen-time and depression (<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2167702617723376">source</a>), others claim instead that children's social relationships, among other things, highly benefit from increased social media use (<a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/138/5/e20162593/60349/Children-and-Adolescents-and-Digital-Media">source</a>). Some disagreeing interpretations can even be witnessed in publications relying on the same data set (see <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0506-1">one</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/2167702617723376">two</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054139X203040312">three</a> for instance). What is more, a 2019 <a href="https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85074050309&partnerID=10&rel=R3.0.0">meta-analysis</a> looking at happiness, life satisfaction, and depression separately found that social network sites (SNS) use was associated with both higher levels of well-being and ill-being. As suggested by a recent <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352250X21001500#bib1">review of reviews</a>, the key to interpreting these results is the observation that ill-being is not simply the flip-side of well-being and vice versa, and that both outcomes should be investigated in their own right. Beware of the oversimplifications: the fact that SMU is associated with both ill- and well- being does not make social media less harmful. The lack of a single trend accounting for all observed behaviours should emphasize the role of context and individual factors in the eventual outcome: the conclusion we are allowed to draw is that whether SM "<i>enhances or diminishes well-being depends on how and why people use it, as well as who uses it</i>" (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33187873/">source</a>). Consequently, the effects of SMU not only vary among users, but in the span of a lifetime they are likely to fluctuate between positive and negative for each individual. <br>
According to the research, social media use is associated with increased depression (<a href="http://doi.org/10.2196/19556">source</a>), panic spread (e.g. related to COVID) and  psychological axiety (especially for the youth aged 18-35 years, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32369026">source</a>), decreased levels of contentment with the self and life (<a href="http://doi.org/10.2196/jmir.2718">source</a>), negative influence on young people’s body image and self-esteem (<a href="time.com/4793331/instagram-social-media-mental-health/">source</a>), the list goes on. On the other hand, research also revealed that SMU can have positive impact on mental health in the years following a disaster (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25566527">source</a>), and be supporting health behavior change among people with serious mental illness (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11126-017-9512-0">source</a>). Moreover, social media has been used to raise awareness about various mental health issues, helping individuals connect and feel that they are not alone (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28381392">source 1</a>, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25374786">source 2</a>), and <a href="http://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-12961-9">one study</a> even demonstrated its effectiveness as a predictive diagnostic tool for depression.<br>
Analyses comparing multiple studies highlight meaningful differences between platforms in their effects on mental health. Specifically, the majority of the studies focusing on Facebook evidenced a slightly more positive relation between usage and mental health: in fact, Facebook can foster well-being through the connection to other users, mental health professionals, and organizations. Quite the opposite is true for Instagram, which has repeatedly been associated with high level of mental health issues, young women being the most affected by the negative impact of the platform. Instagram usage is associated with body image issues, anxiety, depression, bullying, fear of missing out, and disruptive sleep patterns, with assiduous users being reported to develop a <i>"compare or despair"</i> attitude (more <a href="https://www.rsph.org.uk/our-work/campaigns/status-of-mind.html">here</a>). Half-way between these two rather extreme examples is Twitter, which, if not used responsibly, has the potential to negatively influence young people’s body image and self-esteem, but can otherwise become a useful tool to combat mental health issues.<br>
Additionally, as pointed out by a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02109-8">2018 Nature article</a>, the socioeconomic background of (young) SM users is another key aspect determining the quality of their online experience. In particular, the article reported that lower-income youths not only tend to spend more time engaging with screens (on average 3 more hours each day), but are also more susceptible to negative feedback online and their experiences on social media are more likely to result in offline physical fights. 

In conclusion, like any tool ever created, social media can be both harmful and helpful and the most correct, albeit underwhelming, answer to our original question is "it depends". As several recent studies suggest, we shouldn't demonize social media altogether, but we shouldn't turn a blind eye to their potential influence on the users' mental health either. Awareness at the level of the individual and the company is essential to support and safeguard the present users, and, perhaps more importantly, to stir the platforms' development in the right direction, aiming at providing a better experience in the future. 

 <h2> 5. Tomorrow </h2>

The rest of the history of social media still has to be written. The pressing question now is: what will it be about? <br>

Based on recent events we can anticipate several apparently contradictory scenarios. Acknowledging the anarchical energy of social media, autocracies have gradually strengthened their grip on the platforms, often recurring to extreme countermeasures. We've witnessed the phenomenon occur in Russia recently (see <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/21/russia-bans-facebook-and-instagram-under-extremism-law">this</a> or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/30/russia-banned-social-media-platforms-rossgram">this</a>), and not so recently in China, which has been pushing out of the country foreign social media companies   ()
In January this year, the <a href="https://time.com/6139988/countries-where-twitter-facebook-tiktok-banned/">Time</a> has published a list of countries with currently active bans on social media, its length may surprise you.

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/14/technology/linkedin-china-microsoft.html



We have witnessed rising tensions between social media companies and autocracies trying to seize control over the spread of information.  

 Rising mental health issues, especially for the younger population? The fall of freedom of expression and the dream of a united global internet [mention various blockage of social media sites by autocracies]?  Increasing hate speech [mention hate speech problems] and political polarisation [mention polarisation problems]? Fake news and conspiracy theories[mention fake news problems]? Privacy breaches and mass control [mention... ]? Or perhaps stronger sense of community and assistance in case of emergencies [example of the airplane]? Expression for the ones that are systematically left out of the conversation [example here]? Popular movements that bring social change [metoo BLM]? An effective system of mental health support for the most vulnerable [mention ]? Justice and equality? Going even further in time, will we ever "be over" social media? Is a "modern" society possible without them? Phrased differently, are social media here to stay? 

The Netflix series <a>Black Mirror</a> exposes its views ...

How would <u>you</u> want social media to look like in the future?

Black mirror...tries to answer some of these question in its typical dystopic but very accurate/on point style.


In the dystopic but surprisingly actual series Black Mirror they try to imagine what could be the next steps that social media will take now ... 
but examples of social media development can also be read in the metaphors of the matrix ... 

The good part of the story is that we can participate in the answer (if we are aware of the phenomena in the first place).

The bad part is that that what I just said is not entirely true... like with the discovery of america ... all the hands of the companies and our current system makes it hard to change ... but we have to change 


[PART on WHAT HAS BEEN DONE SO FAR]<br>
there are some positive signs though ... humane technologies... 
likely we will never get rid of social media as a species, we are destined to live with or in it forever. but even more so then it is pressing to find a way to reduce its negative consequences.

It is concluded that many of the here presented app-elements on smartphones are able to prolong usage time, but it is very hard to understand such an effect on the level of a single element. A systematic analysis would require insights into app data usually only being available for the app-designers, but not for independent scientists. Nevertheless, the present work supports the notion that it is time to critically reflect on the prevailing business model of ‘user data in exchange for app-use allowance’. Instead of using a service in exchange for data, it ultimately might be better to ban or regulate certain design elements in apps to come up with less addictive products. Instead, users could pay a reasonable fee for an app service.

## Outline 
1. Nosedive, the Social Dilemma, and our future
- Nosedive is an episode from black mirror ... apparent dystopic future where ... how distant from our reality? 
>The majority of the episodes centre on the grim effects of the dominance of future technologies over human life and present warnings about a future that might be just around the corner. Consequently, the series is read as a depiction of the ‘consequences of unchecked techno-capitalism’ on the lives of individuals in ‘a futuristic, dystopian projection’ of the present.

Is social media affecting mental health?

- The relationship between digital technology and mental health has been investigated from many perspective.
- These two papers conduct a review of the research on the topic, agreeing on the presence of both benefits and drawbacks related to social media use. 

        The evidence reviewed here is largely inconclusive with respect to impact on children’s physical activity, but indicates that digital technology seems to be beneficial for children’s social relationships. In terms of impact on children’s mental well-being, the most robust studies suggest that the relationship is U-shaped, where no use and excessive use can have a small negative impact on mental well-being, while moderate use can have a small positive impact.

        Today’s children and adolescents are immersed in both traditional and new forms of digital media. Research on traditional media, such as television, has identified health concerns and negative outcomes that correlate with the duration and content of viewing. Over the past decade, the use of digital media, including interactive and social media, has grown, and research evidence suggests that these newer media offer both benefits and risks to the health of children and teenagers. Evidence-based benefits identified from the use of digital and social media include early learning, exposure to new ideas and knowledge, increased opportunities for social contact and support, and new opportunities to access health promotion messages and information. Risks of such media include negative health effects on sleep, attention, and learning; a higher incidence of obesity and depression; exposure to inaccurate, inappropriate, or unsafe content and contacts; and compromised privacy and confidentiality.

- Recently, concerns have been expressed by researchers, clinicians and the public in regard to apparent compulsive behaviours of digital media users. In this recent review evidence for strong correlation of screentime and obesity and higher depressive symptoms was found. 

        We found moderately strong evidence for associations between screentime and greater obesity/adiposity and higher depressive symptoms; moderate evidence for an association between screentime and higher energy intake, less healthy diet quality and poorer quality of life. There was weak evidence for associations of screentime with behaviour problems, anxiety, hyperactivity and inattention, poorer self-esteem, poorer well-being and poorer psychosocial health, metabolic syndrome, poorer cardiorespiratory fitness, poorer cognitive development and lower educational attainments and poor sleep outcomes. 
        There is evidence that higher levels of screentime is associated with a variety of health harms for CYP, with evidence strongest for adiposity, unhealthy diet, depressive symptoms and quality of life. Evidence to guide policy on safe CYP screentime exposure is limited.

- In a study conducted by royal society of public mental health again social media platforms were associated with both positive and negative effects on the well-being of young individuals. 

    	- Potential negative effects: 
		○ anxiety: One in six young people will experience an anxiety disorder at some point in their lives and identified rates of anxiety and depression in young people have increased by 70% over the past 25 years. Compare and despair attitude
		○ Depression: the intensity of the online world - where teens and young adults are constantly contactable, face pressures from unrealistic representations of reality, and deal with online peer pressure - may be responsible for triggering depression or exacerbating existing conditions 
		○ Sleep quality: Numerous studies have shown that increased social media use has a significant association with poor sleep quality in young people - https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308903222_Social_media_use_fear_of_missing_out_and_sleep_outcomes_in_adolescence
		○ body image
		○ cyber-bullying: Ensuring our young people are safe from abuse online via social media must be a top priority for parents, schools and social media companies. 
		○ FoMO: In essence, FoMO is the worry that social events, or otherwise enjoyable activities, may be taking place without you present to enjoy them. FoMO is characterised by the need to be constantly connected with what other people are doing, so as not to miss out. FoMO is associated with lower mood and lower life satisfaction.
	    - Potential positive effects: 
		○ access to other people's experiences: feeling understood. the act of learning about others’ health experiences may be hugely beneficial to those experiencing health issues themselves. Measures to ensure information is credible and can be trusted by young people would need to be in place before social media is used as a means to spread official health information
		○ emotional support and community building: Sharing problems or issues with friends, peers and broader social networks can be met with positive reaction. Nearly seven in 10 teens report receiving support on social media during tough or challenging times. By joining ‘groups’ or ‘pages’ young people can surround themselves with like-minded people and share their thoughts or concerns. These groups may be minorities in the real world, but can build online communities that provide a safe network for young people, such as those from the LGBTQ+ community or ethnic minorities that are at higher risk for compromised mental health. 
		○ self expression and identity: They are able to personalise their profiles and feeds with images, videos and words that express who they are and how they identify with the world around them. 
		○ maintaining and building relationships: strong adolescent friendships can be enhanced by social media interaction, allowing young people to create stronger bonds with people they already know. Social media can also act as a ‘second phase’ of interaction after an initial face-to-face encounter with someone new. This means even the most brief interactions can be continued via social media whereas these relationships may have otherwise been lost. 

- A report published in Clinical Psychological Science in 2018 featured two cross-sectional surveys of 506,820 American high school students, and found that use of digital media was associated with higher rates of depressive symptoms and suicidality

        In two nationally representative surveys of U.S. adolescents in grades 8 through 12 (N = 506,820) and national statistics on suicide deaths for those ages 13 to 18, adolescents’ depressive symptoms, suicide-related outcomes, and suicide rates increased between 2010 and 2015, especially among females. Adolescents who spent more time on new media (including social media and electronic devices such as smartphones) were more likely to report mental health issues, and adolescents who spent more time on nonscreen activities (in-person social interaction, sports/exercise, homework, print media, and attending religious services) were less likely.

-  A 2018 review published in Nature considered that young people may have different experiences online, depending on their socio-economic background, noting lower-income youths may spend up to three hours more per day using digital devices, compared to higher-income youths. They theorised that lower-income youths, who are already vulnerable to mental illness, may be more passive in their online engagements, being more susceptible to negative feedback online, with difficulty self-regulating their digital media use. It concluded that this may be a new form of digital divide between at-risk young people and other young people, pre-existing risks of mental illness becoming amplified among the already vulnerable population



Can we rethink the present to shape the future? Use Twitter to get flying cars? 

In the history of humanity we have been repeating the same mistake over and over again: we inhumanely exploit other people blinded by our self-interest, forgetting that they too can feel and think just like we do. The Spanish colonisation of the Americas in the 16th century is a blatant example of this natural tendency to brutality: it is estimated that around 8 million indigenous people died to the hand of European conquistadores, on the search for land and gold. What has happened in the last 20 years makes no exception: the only difference now is that everyone is getting exploited, even those who profit from it. The modest success of early Social Media sites were the equivalent of Columbus discovery: a new land had just been uncovered, promising to make reach the first digital conquistador daring to conquer it. I believe that just like Columbus, the tech companies did not understand true nature of the change they were about to bring.  

“there was not much thought given to the long-term negative consequences of developing such a platform.” This is exactly the problem with our increased pace of innovation. These companies are too worried about pushing hot new technologies and beating competitors to market so they often times do not look at the long-term effects it could have on society.
