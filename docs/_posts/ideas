what Europe means today and what it will mean in the future ("A place for Europe")

on AI powered automatic weapons, war and the future of our species
- USA, China racing to get armed ---> cite scene from James Dean movie
    - like atomic bomb, ... maybe other examples here 
    - follow the usual logic: you have to eat if you don't want to get eaten 
- wait a minute: let's unpack it 
- we as a species have many problems to face in the next 100 years (21 challenges for 21st century)
    - instead of spending our money and best minds on increasing our chaces of survival
    we spend them on increasing our chances of annihilation 
    - it's like we're really trying hard to go extint 
- we need to get perspective 
    - people in power have a responsibility: We need the people that are in power to get out of this  fool and foul logic of war. 
    - as researchers we have responsibilities: 
        - we need to refuse to put our work to this use 
        - we need to explain clearly the limitations and potential risks
    - as humans we have one responsibility: to get the people worried about this. about our future. 
    Sometimes people call me naive. They do it because I believe that this can work. 
    I believe that humans can survive. Because our mind was built to adapt to changes in 
    the environment fast, so as to increase our chances of survival. We now need to 
    adapt our deeply rooted overdue war logic to a more peaceful and cooperative perspectve. 
    If we want our species to survive we need to start thinking like one. Cite Darwin here.
