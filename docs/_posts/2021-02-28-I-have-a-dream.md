I have a dream about all of us and about none of us. It is about the future of the human society. A future maybe too distant from the present to gain corporeal consistency in my lifespan and probably yours. \\
I dream of a kind revolution that will mark the start of a new era for our species. It will be to us now as the emergence of language has been to our ancenstors 3274 years ago.
