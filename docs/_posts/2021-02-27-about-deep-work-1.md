## Intro to the series

<div align="justify">
This is the first of a series of four articles that will revisit from a personal experience perspective some of the concepts emerging from the book titled "Deep Work" by Cal Newport. These articles belong to a single essay which I had written now more than an year ago and never published for its discouraging length. The series is organised as follows: except for the first (present) article, which also bears an introduction within itself, each post will be centered around a lesson. Working out the math you get four lessons in total. It certainly is going to be a reductive account of the content of the book that inspires the series, which is not meant to be by any means a complete summary of the former. The ideal reader would approach these blog posts with the spirit of a child who is about to be told a bedtime story: no expectations, but a curios mind.

## Intro to the topic


<div align="justify">
As you may already have guessed from the title of Cal Newport's book the topic of the discussion is productivity. But what is productivity? <br><br>

I can't remember how it started, but time management has a central role in my life today. The people who know me would probably say that I'm obsessed with schedules. And sometimes I find myself agreeing with them. The reason is that I'd like to avoid wasting time living a life I'm not proud of. </div>As [Mark Manson](https://markmanson.net/) puts it: 

> Every moment of every day, whether you realize it or not, you are making a decision on how to spend your time, on what to pay attention to, on where to direct your energy. [...]
Our values are constantly reflected in the way we choose to behave.<br>


<div align="justify">
So for me productivity is about giving value to what we do. <br>
The title of a recent book from <a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/">David Allen</a> suggests that <i>productivity is the ability of getting things done</i>. All these productivity "studies" recently flooding the internet usually (check for yourself) transcend the specifics of what you are actually "getting done", which has always been the subject of philosophy, or theology. Instead productivity offers a pseudo-scientific, rigorous approach to stay true to the goals you have set for yourself, avoiding to spend (too much) time on "things" that you do not value. 
<br>
<br>
Now, getting practical, <b>productivity is hard</b>.  There is no "<i>perfect routine</i>" because the circumstances change all the time, often without warning (covid has mercilessly demonstrated the truth of this last statement). In software engineering terms, planning your days is a product in <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ContinuousDelivery.html">continuous delivery</a>. The goal is not to find the shoe that fits your foot but instead to learn to walk well on the ones that you are given. I have been collecting <i>productivity heuristics</i> through the last 3-4 years, unaware of the public discourse on the subject, to which I've only recently been introduced. This discovery offered me the chance to compare my findings to what the "experts" are saying on the topic at the moment, and sharing the results of this comparison is exactly the goal of this post.

## Intro to the book


<div align="justify">
This is not a book on productivity. I know, now you're confused. <br>
"Deep Work" is first of all an eulogy and an apology of what Newport defines (guess what) <i>deep work</i>: <br>
<br>
</div>

> Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.
<div align="justify">
Indeed the book is organized in two sections and the first one is entirely dedicated to the definition of deep work in contrast to "shallow work".  In the span of three chapters, Newport describes deep work as a crucial skill "<i>for anyone looking to move ahead in a globally competitive information economy that tends to chew up and spit out those who arenâ€™t earning their keep</i>". In order to support his thesis he submits to the reader multiple arguments based on psychology, neuroscience and social science studies, as well as ancient and recent success stories. 
<br>

In this post we'll only consider the second part of the book, which introduces the reader to a series of techniques (called "rules") to improve the deep work skill. 
Even though originally crafted in the deep work setting, I believe the concepts presented in the second part of the book to be valuable and useful in the broader quest for productivity, and perhaps also beyond it. With this in mind, I will be discussing the second half of the book purely in productivity terms. 
<br> 
<br>

Let me start with a DISCLAIMER. Newport exposes many techniques leading up to the celebrated deep work state, often spending a significant portion of a chapter discussing the "implementation details". 
Going from the theory read in a book to the everyday practice is hard, especially if you're not given much material advice. However, in my humble opinion <b>productivity is a personal journey</b> and any attempt to shape it into a prescription is doomed to fail. Even equipped with the best of Newport advice, you will need to find out by yourself what works better for you. As many have said before me, the road to success is paved with failed attempts: don't give up!

## Lesson #1:  Embrace boredom

<div align="justify">
What comes as a natural measure for the quality of a plan is <b>efficiency</b>, which we can formally phrase as the number of goals accomplished per day. 



Intuitively, efficiency is the direct answer to the question: "<i>how much have you done today</i>", which is to my surprise often confused with the question "<i>how satisfied are you with your day</i>"? In an ideal world the key to efficiency is a better plan: one doesn't have to turn down any  opportunity if he's a good enough planner.

</div>
You want a good job or you already have one and you want to do your best so you put in those extra hours and energy every day. And you want to stay healthy and fit, so you take time to cook good meals and visit the gym regularly. You also may want to keep up with your share of social life, and you may have a romantic partner, a dog and possibly even kids to whom you want to dedicate a substantial portion of your "quality time". Then one day on a social media you read of this unique opportunity to be part of a band, or to become an active member of a charity organisation, or a professional cook, or any other thing you have always dreamed of. And you just can't say no. So you keep saying yes, armed with the belief that some tweaks in your schedule will make the trick. This perspective naturally leads to (obsessive) multitasking, which, let's be honest, works very well in the beginning. The problems arise when you let these early successes convince you that anything is achievable this way, that you just need to press down on the accelerator and everything will magically fit and hold together.
<br>
<br>
FLASH NEWS: <i>human beings don't work this way</i>. <br>
In the introduction to the chapter Cal Newport cites <a href="https://www.npr.org/2013/05/10/182861382/the-myth-of-multitasking?t=1599744251093">this interesting interview</a> from Clifford Nass, who describes the *myth of multitasking* as follows: 
</div> <br>

> **Nass**: So we have scales that allow us to divide up people into people who multitask all the time and people who rarely do, and the differences are remarkable. People who multitask all the time can't filter out irrelevancy. They can't manage a working memory. They're chronically distracted. 

And a few sentences later: 

> **Interviewer**: So they - all because they have been multitasking- they've lost that ability to focus on one thing.<br>
**Nass**: That's precisely right. Our brains have to be retrained to multitask and our brains, if we do it all the time - brains are remarkably plastic, remarkably adaptable. We train our brains to a new way of thinking. And then when we try to revert our brains back, our brains are plastic but they're not elastic. They don't just snap back into shape.


<div align="justify">
As Nass is highlighting here, <b>there is a fallacy in the efficiency-is-the-key mindset</b>. The problem stems from the fact that the mind easily develops addiction to stimuli, and anything that represents a distraction from your current occupation will come to you in form of a stimulus. When you multitask the "frequency" of your input stimuli increases, which has the undesired effect of lowering your attention threshold. Think about this: how often do you find yourself doing exactly nothing, i.e. letting your mind free to wander without cracking under the pressure of refreshing your favorite social media homepage, picking up a new activity or simply checking (again) the email?<br>
What professor Nass is revealing is that multitasking has consequences, which is far from a known and it is a surely underestimated fact. The consequence of course being the loss of your ability to focus more than 2 minutes on any given task. 
</div>
<!-- Even though it is hard to accept, we must face the truth, which is that we humans have limits, like the number of days we got left to live, or the length of the longest sequence of numbers that we can memorize. The number of activities you can commit to on each day is another example of such a limit, and there's no scheduling trick that can help you escape this rule.<br> -->
<br> 

*So what should we do instead?*


#### Forget efficiency, embrace boredom.
<div align = "justify">
This is "rule" number 2, and it is the subject of a whole chapter in the Deep Work book (chapter 2, part 2).
The chapter dwells on ways to push the limit of your concentration, proposing a few strategies that can help the reader rewire his brain to a configuration better suited for staying on task.
<div align="left">
<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/2UwXedfUGsXJfLR2XL/giphy.gif" width="300" style="float: left;margin-right: 7px;margin-top: 0px;margin-btm:17px;">
</div>
<i>Productive meditation, distraction breaks, hard deadlines for focused tasks</i> are some examples of the suggestions to "<i>strengthen your distraction-resisting muscles</i>", and "<i>improve your ability to think deeply</i>".
This is not what I will cover now though, as I would like to spend the last words in this section on the core concept: embracing boredom. <br>
When later today you will find yourself free from your daily business try to notice where your mind goes. Instinctively your attention will be drawn to any stimulus in your environment in an attempt to escape the sudden boredom. Even though you now know it, you will give in to this instinct without noticing. However, not all hope is lost, as to gain control of your attention is just a matter of practice. And the method to practice on could hardly be more straightforward. When the compulsion arrives you have to literally do nothing. <i>Embrace boredom</i>.
<br>
The simplicity of the approach is maybe the feature that persuaded me to give it a try. 
What Newport is saying here should seem counter-intuitive to those of us accustomed to the breaks-averse, the work-until-you-pass-out approach. The shift in perspective is radical: <b>to be more productive you should do less</b>. Instead of banning breaks from your workday you should plan them. Vacancy is glorified not vilified. Instead of chasing efficiency with some kind of "schedule horror vacui" we should be digging holes in our routines, as the most powerful weapon against "shallowness", he argues, is emptiness. The right anthem therefore is not "<i>more, more, more</i>", but "<i>less, less, less</i>"...

This was it for today's lesson. See you on the next one.

<!--

Newport reserves an entire section of the book to argue the importance of the ability to work in a deep mode (chapter 1 to 3), contextualizing the need of this skill in the Internet era. <br>
He focuses on an intellectual kind of work, like the one he does, being an associate professor of computer science at Georgetown University. However, I believe we can extend the definition of Deep Work to a whole *attitude towards life*, which we could maybe call *Deep mode* and phrase as follows: 
> **Deep Mode**: A state of distraction-free concentration that keeps you fully immersed in your current activity. <br> 

What I here call *deep mode* is similar in spirit to what in positive psychology is known as [*the flow*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)) or *the zone*. Call it *Deep work* or *Deep mode* or even *Flow*, the problem is that focus does not get along well with a frenetic routine. 

[](https://web.archive.org/web/20131110043540/http://articlescoertvisser.blogspot.com/2007/11/good-business-leadership-flow-and.html)

This last point is the one upon which Newport builds his argument, depicting the ability to work in *a deep way* as essential to obtain a certain level of quality in your results, if not to get results at all. The problem is that a slow-rate working mode does not match a frenetic routine. The deep work settings usually require your brain to engage in a prolonged effort while receiving little to no rewards at all, with a few inputs that come in at a low frequency. As you might have noticed, reading a scientific article feels different from writing an e-mail, having a phone call or attending a conference. The reason is that you're using your brain at two fundamentally distinct rates.<br>


While jdhbfj you think you'll do more you actually end up doing less.
