## Intro

### Lesson #4: The shutdown

This last lesson will be a short one. The idea is discussed in the same chapter that interested lesson #2 and lesson #3, which is maybe the most rich in practical advices.<br>
When I first read about the idea I was extremely excited because I had previously conceived a productivity heuristic (the *fuck-up day*) which precisely matched the concept. <br>
As you'll see, Newport's implementation differs from mine, but once again: productivity is a personal journey. <br>
The method is simple to execute, and surprisingly effective. I hope that when I'll be finished presenting it you'll share some of my enthusiasm for it. <br>
I'll first discuss the insight, to then briefly touch on the two implementations. <br>

The general concept is that our minds (as well as our bodies) need a **periodic shutdown** to function properly if they're regularly under pressure. This is not something that can be defeated with a bit of exercise: it's physiological. 
Newport as usual provides plenty of evidence in support of the idea, but I'll discuss my favorite one here. 

The attention restoration theory (ART) claims that spending time in nature (instead of in the city) can improve our ability to concentrate. This theory, which was first proposed in the 1980s by the University of Michigan psychologists Rachel Kaplan and Stephen Kaplan is based on the concept of *attention fatigue*. To concentrate requires what ART calls "*directed attention*". This resource is finite: If you exhaust it, youâ€™ll struggle to concentrate. <br>
A paper from 2008 discovered a significant difference in the ability to concentrate between a group asked to take a walk in the city and another asked to walk in a park instead. A possible explanation for the phenomenon is that navigating through the busy city streets requires a consistent level of directed attention, while walking through nature keeps the mind stimulated without requiring directed attention. <br> 
But Newport is not suggesting to leave the city for the better, *hashtag #countrylife*. As he highlights, the implications of ART expand beyond the benefits of nature. The core mechanism of the theory is that you can restore your (highly valuable) ability to direct your attention by assigning some time to a relaxing activity. It doesn't have to be nature, but it must be something that fascinates you enough to avoid the risk of stopping to check emails in the middle of the break. Beware as the more pressuring your duties (think of an approaching deadline), the harder it will be to take a break from them, and hence the smarter you'll have to be when choosing the restoring activity.

This is most likely not the first time you hear about the benefits of relax, so what's all the fuss about? Thanks for the question. <br> 
The findings from ART theory are not praising rest per se, but they depict it as an essential ingredient in a mentally/physically engaging routine. As Newport says:  
> Put another way, trying to squeeze a little more work out of your evenings might reduce your effectiveness the next day enough that you end up getting less done than if you had instead respected a shutdown.

This *less-is-more* chorus may remind you of lesson #1: embrace boredom. However, while there I was advocating against the efficiency-is-the-key mindset, here I am advocating for a specific activity: resting.

Now, we finally go into what me and Newport have to suggest you.
