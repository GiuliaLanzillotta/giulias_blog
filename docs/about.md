This is me! I'm currently studying Data Science in the beautiful Zurich @ [ETH](https://ethz.ch/en.html). I am passionate about too many things and I am terrible at giving up, so on I daily basis I fight to channel my curiosity stream on a few tasks. I'm addicted to podcasts, coffee and challenges. And I love asking questions! 

I'm writing down some of the interesting stuff I come across on this site. If there's something you want to ask, write me an e-mail, or simply connect with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JuliaLanzi). I also have a [Medium](https://medium.com/@lanzillottagiulia97) profile, and I'll probably keep updating that one as well in the future.
