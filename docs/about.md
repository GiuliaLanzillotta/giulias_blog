Hi there, welcome to my own little corner of the internet. The girl in the picture up there is me. I'm currently living in the beautiful Zurich, studying towards a PhD at the lively @[ETH AI Center](https://ai.ethz.ch), where with a team of brilliant and passionate people we focus on AI to solve many of the world's most pressing challenges. If you want to know more about my research interests please visit [this page]({{ site.baseurl }}/CV/), or just [send me an email](mailto:lanzillotta.stud@gmail.com).


Now, a couple of unrequested facts about me. I like coffee, sunny seaside towns, honesty and British humor. In the ever-lasting fight between cats and dogs I side with dogs (but sweet cats can easily win me over). My spirit animal is mid-way between Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts. Basically I'm a Notting Hill kid. I have many addictions considering that I haven't been on this planet that long: I especially need movies, long runs and podcasts to keep on going through life. Generally speaking, I believe in hard work and commitment, but I value above any form of excellence a balanced and healthy perspective on life.  

Finally, I'll give you some actual information about this blog. There's no fixed theme really, so I don't know what I will be writing about. I would not be surprised to find something on AI (after all that's what I'm spending most of my time on), with the addition of philosophy, history and personal growth/life hacks. I also write and read poetry, maybe I'll put up an entertainment recommendation wall somewhere in the website. 

I believe that's all for now. I'll leave you with one of my dearest quotes:
> Life is not a race, it is an archery competition: what matters is not cutting the finish line but finding your centre. <br>
