## Hi there, 
welcome to my own little corner of the internet.   

The girl in the picture up there is me. 
A couple of unrequested facts about me. I like coffee, sunny seaside towns, honesty and British humor. In the ever-lasting fight between cats and dogs I side with dogs (but sweet cats can easily win me over). My spirit is mid-way between Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts. Basically I'm a Notting Hill kid. I have many addictions, but they never stay the same. When I'm not working, I'm watching movies, doing sports or asking very odd questions (e.g. when was the concept of breakfast born?)
I believe in hard work and commitment, but I value a balanced and healthy perspective on life above any form of excellence. My opinions are always evolving, so don't take anything you read here as absolute truth—if there's any such thing.
This is my blog, which is a space where I feel free to share my thoughts and most random interests. Just like in my life, there's no fixed theme or grand vision. If you like some of my thoughts, or equally if you don't and have something to tell me feel free to [send me an email](mailto:lanzillotta.stud@gmail.com). That's all for now.

## News

I do research on *continual learning*. If you want to know why, check out my post [this page]({{ site.baseurl }}/2024-12-22/coming_soon). 

Here's the latest:

- 🔗 Our paper *Asymptotic Analysis of Deep and Shallow Forgetting with Neural Collapse* is on ArXiv. Check out the **[paper](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2512.07400)** here.
- 🎙️ **Oct 25**. I presented our work on Knowledge Distillation at the *DL Math & Efficiency Reading Group.* Check out the **[recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoogPonpLz8&list=PLhie7c12ajwoSpcy8jeb8qo_GIKuEPYpR&index=4)** here.
- 🔗 Our paper *Revisiting Knowledge Distillation: The Hidden Role of Dataset Size* is on ArXiv. Check out the **[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15516)** here.
- 🎙️ **July 25.** I moderated the discussion on Continual Learning at the **[Bayes Duality Workshop](https://bayesduality.github.io/workshop_2025.html)** with Siddharth Swaroop. 
- 🍣 **April 25.** I joined the **[Adaptive Bayesian Intelligence Lab](https://adaptive-bayesian.ai)** for an internship. 
- 🎙️ **March 25.** I gave a talk at the *ETH AI Center Associated Researchers Meetup.* <br>
    Title: **Beyond the training-deployment cycle: state of continual learning with neural networks.**

Check out my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eiB9OOkAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=3) page for the most up-to-date list of my scientific writings.
