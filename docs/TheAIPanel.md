### Hello everyone, 
#### welcome to the AI panel.
<div align="justify">
I wrongly borrowed the word panel: there are not going to be dialogs or interviews, and there is (unfortunately) not going to be any live interaction between us - though discussions over emails are more than welcome. This is another series of posts, that I prefer to call <it>panel</it> because there is no endpoint to reach, no scheduled route to follow -just like in a typical conversation. I've been wanting to start this panel for quite some time now as it will hopefully tidy up the bundle of considerations that have been piling up (literally in my notes) for maybe a couple of years. The panel will enjoy a common theme over its inherent heterogeneity of topics which is the big elephant in this (also very big) room called AI.

Nowadays there's a mix of hope and fear from the general public surrounding the AI community. We should praise the work of many journalists for hyping up the field so much (furthermore over some 'cat VS dog' recognition problem). I should probably be thanking these journalists personally for engaging my curiosity in this domain since I eventually decided to make a living of it and for giving me the opportunity to do so as most of AI's present success in the industry is again due to fancy articles like <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/could-ai-keep-people-alive-after-death-11625317200">this one</a> - which was honestly the result of not even a 1 minute scroll on Google News when typing in 'AI'. One good measure of the cruising speed the field has reached is the number of papers that are being submitted every year at the major conferences - 6,743 for Neurips 2019, which is 4 times what it was in 2015. In <a href="https://yoshuabengio.org/2020/02/26/time-to-rethink-the-publication-process-in-machine-learning/">this blog post</a> Joshua Bengio explains the phenomenon better than I would -and from a more informed standpoint- so I'll quote some words here:

> The research culture has also changed in the last few decades. It is more competitive, everything is happening fast and putting a lot of pressure on everyone, the field has grown exponentially in size, students are more protective of their ideas and in a hurry to put them out, by fear that someone else would be working on the same thing elsewhere, and in general a PhD ends up with at least 50% more papers than what I gather it was 20 or 30 years ago.

<div align ="justify">
In a nutshell, the 'AI' research world in the last 20 years (even 10 if we look <a href="https://aiindex.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-AI-Index-Report_Master.pdf">here</a>) has turned into a huge publishing machine, constantly racing towards the next conference, flying from one idea to the next one like bees in a flower field. Having a considerable amount of papers published can significantly improve the chances of a young student to enter a research lab. So publishing papers is "cool". And if something is "cool" we just do it without thinking.

Perhaps today more than ever AI researchers should instead take some time off from this conference compulsion every now and then to ask themselves very fundamental questions like: <i>where are we headed? </i> This kind of '<i>big picture</i>' thinking is today still relegated to dinner or bar conversations, while there is a noticeable lack of it in the scientific discourse on AI. One of the high-level goals of this panel is to make you ask yourselves many questions of this sort. Good questions are the starting point of good research. I've been asking myself these questions for some time, which has led me to follow a specific research trend and has sharpened my interest over very specific problems in the domain. However this is not a one time process that prevents you from ever falling again in a whimsical spiral of conference papers: we need to keep asking ourselves these questions periodically - and I'm not saying this to make you come back to the website, I swear ... <br><br>
There is also another -more secondary- high-level goal, and this is probably the place where to mention it. As I introduce to you the fundamental questions I'll also present some of the ideas that I picked up on my way here. I cannot guarantee a linear flow in the discussion, as usually the right input for the insight would arrive far after the question (days or months), but I hope to uncover some structure as I write them down to you.

I'll be adding below the links to the posts taking part in this 'discussion panel' as they come out. Goodbye for now, wishing you dear reader to enjoy the uncertainty as much as the discoveries that usually come with it.
