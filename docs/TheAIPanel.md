### Hello everyone, 
<div align="justify">
welcome to the AI panel. <br><br>
I wrongly borrowed the word panel: there are not going to be dialogs or interviews, and there is (unfortunately) not going to be any live interaction between us - though discussions over emails are more than welcome. This is another series of posts, that I prefer to call <it>panel</it> because there is no endpoint to reach, no scheduled route to follow -just like in a typical conversation. I've been wanting to start this panel for quite some time now as it will hopefully tidy up the bundle of considerations that have been piling up (literally piling up in my notes) for maybe a couple of years. The panel will enjoy a common theme over its inherent heterogeneity of topics which is the big elephant in this (also very big) room called AI.

It is no secret that nowadays there's a mix of hope and fear surrounding the AI community.
...(papers frequency major conferences, BERTs flavours)...
Now more than ever we should be asking ourselves questions such as : where are we headed? What are we doing? What exactly do we want to achieve? What kind of *intelligence* do we need? ... 
There is no point in racing without a finish line. And that is what most of the AI scientific community is doing today. I don't have the presumption of identifying this final goal of AI here. What I would like to do however is to start asking myself and you these fundamental questions that have been excluded from the scientific discourse and confined to bar/dinner/[insert here any free time social activity] chats for too long now.<br>

A second ambitious goal of this series of posts is to give a structure to the reasoning around these topics. ... use comics to say that big problems don't exist, only chunks of small problems exist...



With no further ado, let me point you to the posts in this discussion. <br>
