### Hello everyone! 
Here we hopefully talk about AI (yes, pluralis majestatis). HOWEVER no technical reviews are allowed (at list for now, the rules can change since I am the one setting them -evil laugh in the background-) AND there will be a single general theme among all the posts here, which I may present to you with a few extracts from [Calvin and Hobbes](https://www.calvinandhobbes.com/about-calvin-and-hobbes/).

It is no secret that nowadays there's a mix of hope and fear surrounding the AI community.
...(papers frequency major conferences, BERTs flavours)...
Now more than ever we should be asking ourselves questions such as : where are we headed? What are we doing? What exactly do we want to achieve? What kind of *intelligence* do we need? ... 
There is no point in racing without a finish line. And that is what most of the AI scientific community is doing today. I don't have the presumption of identifying this final goal of AI here. What I would like to do however is to start asking myself and you these fundamental questions that have been excluded from the scientific discourse and confined to bar/dinner/[insert here any free time social activity] chats for too long now.<br>

A second ambitious goal of this series of posts is to give a structure to the reasoning around these topics. ... use comics to say that big problems don't exist, only chunks of small problems exist...




With no further due, let me point you to the posts in this discussion. <br>
